<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced, following very recent discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), withdrawal of the New Drug Application (NDA) for palovarotene. This follows ongoing dialogue with the FDA following the acceptance of the NDA for Priority Review which was announced on 28 May 2021. During the review and ongoing dialogue between Ipsen and the FDA, it was recognized that additional analyses and evaluation of data collected from Ipsen’s Phase III MOVE and FOP program would be required to progress and complete the review process. It was agreed between Ipsen and the FDA that it would not be possible to complete this within the current NDA review cycle. As a result, Ipsen has therefore confirmed their withdrawal of the NDA for palovarotene. After recent discussion with FDA, Ipsen plans to resubmit to the FDA upon completion of the additional data analyses.

Dr. Howard Mayer, Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development, Ipsen, said “We remain committed to the FOP community through our clinical programs for Ipsen’s two investigational therapies palovarotene and IPN60130. We recognize the urgency from this community to bring a much-needed treatment option to people living with FOP around the world. Unfortunately, as there is no regulatory mechanism to “pause” the current ongoing review process, we have taken the decision to withdraw the NDA for palovarotene to undertake the additional analyses and evaluation needed, with plans to resubmit the data for palovarotene as soon as possible.”

Palovarotene is an oral, investigational, selective RARγ agonist for the prevention of heterotropic ossification (new bone formation) as a potential treatment for people living with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The target regulatory action date assigned by the FDA under a Priority Review status for palovarotene was 30 November 2021.

FOP is an ultra-rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals globally; however, the number of confirmed cases varies by country.<sup>1,2</sup> It is characterized by new bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system, like in soft connective tissues, a process known as heterotopic ossification (HO),<sup>3</sup> which can be preceded by painful soft-tissue swelling or “flare-ups”.<sup>2</sup> Flare-up episodes are common and are a substantial contributor to the formation of new HO, however HO can form in the absence of a flare-up. HO, once formed, is irreversible and leads to loss of mobility and shortened life expectancy.<sup>3</sup>
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>ENDS</b></p>
<b>About the palovarotene FOP clinical program
</b>The Phase III MOVE (NCT03312634) trial is an ongoing open-label, single-arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a chronic/flare-up dosing regimen of palovarotene, which comprises a 5mg daily dose that is increased at the start of a flare-up to 20mg for four weeks, followed by 10mg for eight weeks. At the end of the flare-up dosing period, the dose returns to the chronic 5mg daily dose. All dosing is weight-adjusted in skeletally immature participants (those under the age of 18 years with less than 90% skeletal maturity on hand/wrist x-rays performed at screening). The trial is being conducted in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<sup>4</sup> There are two ongoing Phase II (PVO-1A-202 [NCT02279095] and PVO-1A-204 [NCT02979769]) extension trials: 1) Study 202, an open-label extension of Study 201, the initial Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial; and 2) Study 204, an open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different palovarotene dosing regimens in patients with FOP in France.

In December 2019, a partial clinical hold was applied to participants under the age of 14 years participating in the Phase II (PVO-1A-202/204 and PVO-2A-201) and Phase III (PVO-1A-301) studies at all clinical sites globally. This was due to reports of premature physeal closure (PPC). A decision to pause dosing of palovarotene in all remaining participants in the global Phase III MOVE trial (PVO-1A-301), as well as the ongoing Phase II (PVO-1A-202/204) extension studies in FOP was made by Ipsen on January 24, 2020, based on results of a futility analysis as part of the pre-specified interim analysis (Bayesian compound Poisson analysis with square root transformation of the new HO volume data).

*Encouraging therapeutic activity was observed in post hoc analyses of interim data for the Phase III MOVE trial and shared with, and acknowledged by, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Post hoc analyses included Bayesian compound Poisson analysis without square-root transformation, and weighted linear mixed-effects models (with/without square-root transformation of the new HO volume data). As such, the Company amended the protocol for the Phase III MOVE trial to include updates to the statistical-analysis section, including additional analyses requested by the IDMC, to be performed in addition to the primary pre-specified analysis. The protocol amendments are based on the IDMC’s observation that the protocol pre-specified statistical model may have negatively affected the efficacy analysis and appears to have shifted the statistical conclusion from significant therapeutic benefit to showing futility of the treatment. Dosing for eligible study patients ≥14 years of age has resumed as of March 26, 2020 across the Phase II and Phase III programs for palovarotene in FOP.

<b>About palovarotene
</b>Palovarotene is an oral investigational, selective retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonist being developed as a potential treatment for people living with the debilitating ultra-rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Palovarotene, which received rare pediatric disease and breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA for the potential treatment of FOP, was acquired by Ipsen through the acquisition of Clementia Pharmaceuticals in April 2019. The palovarotene NDA was accepted by the U.S. FDA for Priority Review on 28 May 2021.

<b>Ipsen’s forward-looking statements
</b>The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’, ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business, financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Regdanvimab (CT-P59) receives emergency use authorisation from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA, Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID

August 12 2021, INCHEON, KOREA – Celltrion Healthcare today announced that the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) has granted an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the company’s monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19, regdanvimab (CT-P59) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID.[1]

Brazil had the highest number of confirmed cases from COVID-19 in Latin America with an average of 35,000 cases per day. Since the beginning of the pandemic, at least 1 in 10 residents have been infected, a total of 20,249,176 reported cases.[2]

“Today’s announcement of emergency use authorisation for regdanvimab takes us a significant step closer to providing a safe and effective monoclonal antibody treatment against COVID-19 to patients in Brazil,” said Dr. HoUng Kim, Ph.D., Head of Medical and Marketing Division at Celltrion Healthcare. “Regdanvimab demonstrated a promising safety, tolerability, antiviral effect and efficacy profile in its global clinical trial. The use of monoclonal antibodies is an important tool in the fight against COVID-19. We are actively exploring additional authorisation in other countries and regions to help COVID-19 patients around the world.”

Celltrion’s global Phase III data showed regdanvimab (CT-P59) significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death by 72% for patients at high- risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and 70% for all patients. In addition, patients who were treated with regdanvimab (CT-P59) reported a significantly shortened time to clinical recovery by at least 4.7 days for patients at high- risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and by 4.9 days compared to placebo for all patients.

In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated potency of regdanvimab (CT-P59) against multiple variants of concern including the Alpha (B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), Beta (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa)[3], Gamma (P.1, first identified in Brazil) [4] and Delta (B.1.617.2, first identified in India) variants. The monoclonal antibody regdanvimab (CT-P59) also demonstrated strong neutralising capability against the Lambda variant (C.37, first identified in Peru) in a cell-based pseudo- virus assay study performed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S.

About regdanvimab (CT-P59)

CT-P59 was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates and selecting those that showed the highest potency in neutralising the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In vitro and in vivo pre- clinical studies showed that CT-P59 strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and significantly neutralise the wild type and mutant variants of concern including the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK). In in vivo models, CT-P59 effectively reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and inflammation in lung. Results from the global Phase I and II clinical trials of CT-P59 demonstrated a promising safety, tolerability, antiviral effect and efficacy profile in patients with mild- to- moderate symptoms of COVID-19.[5] Celltrion also has recently commenced the development of a neutralising antibody cocktail with CT-P59 against new emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.

<p align=""left"">SHANGHAI, China and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Aug. 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd (“Junshi Biosciences”, HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) and Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus”, Nasdaq: CHRS) today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for the 1<sup>st</sup> line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”). The FDA had earlier granted BTD for toripalimab monotherapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BTD is intended to expedite the development and regulatory review of drugs where preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over existing therapies for a severe or life-threating disease. Drugs with BTD will be granted closer FDA guidance – including that from senior FDA officials - and various forms of support to avail patients with new therapy as soon as possible.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Junshi Biosciences expects to complete the biologics license application (“BLA”) submission for toripalimab plus chemotherapy for 1st line NPC and for toripalimab monotherapy for 2nd or 3rd line NPC later this quarter.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy designation for our novel PD-1 blocking antibody, toripalimab, for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is an aggressive cancer with no immuno-oncology treatment options approved in the United States,” said Dr. Patricia Keegan, Chief Medical Officer of Junshi Biosciences. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA during the BLA review process and with our partner, Coherus, to bring toripalimab to NPC patients in the U.S., if approved.”</p>
The Breakthrough Therapy designation is supported by data from the Phase 3 clinical trial “JUPITER-02” evaluating toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of NPC. In this study, toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival (“PFS”) compared to chemotherapy alone (assessed by a blinded independent review committee (“BIRC”) per RECIST v1.1). JUPITER-02 also met secondary endpoints of PFS assessed by the investigator and objective response rate assessed by BIRC. There was also a longer duration of response, a higher disease control rate, and higher one- and two-year survival rates for the toripalimab arm. The safety profile of toripalimab is consistent with that observed in previously reported toripalimab clinical trials and the safety profile of this class of drugs. The result of JUPITER-02 was recently presented at the ASCO plenary session (#LBA2) and full results can be found in the August 2021 <a title=""on-line edition of Nature Medicine"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nbjD2OtkXdKn5Y2817IB5yUKtKj2m50ODhNivi3kemfD62KDPQf1Lz48KfdBBcWmm6gImj4E68_kJsZ74nFeZuTCyoIWh8pTUYfgvujLMk9UNJ2Sug9KAc4ebACPt8U8TUDf_tGLyTnb-aKrUz7LIw=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">on-line edition of Nature Medicine</a>.

<strong>About toripalimab</strong>
Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 is thought to recharge the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells.

More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally, including in China and the United States. Pivotal clinical trials are ongoing or completed evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab for a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.

In China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI<sup>®</sup>). On December 17, 2018, toripalimab was granted a conditional approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In December 2020, toripalimab was successfully included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List. In February 2021, the supplemental NDA for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was accepted by the NMPA. In the same month, the NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. In April, NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.
<p align=""justify"">In the United States, a rolling submission of the first toripalimab Biologics License Application (BLA) is underway for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1<sup>st</sup> line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”) and also for toripalimab monotherapy in second or third line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. There are currently no PD-1 blocking antibodies indicated for use in NPC in the United States. Additionally, FDA has granted Fast Track status for the development of toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designation for NPC, mucosal melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Earlier in 2021 Coherus in-licensed rights to develop and commercialize toripalimab in the United States and Canada. Coherus and Junshi Biosciences plan to file additional toripalimab BLAs with the FDA over the next three years for multiple rare cancers and highly prevalent cancers.</p>

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--<b>Sesen Bio</b> (Nasdaq: SESN), a late-stage clinical company developing targeted fusion protein therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer, today announced that it received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Biologics License Application (BLA) for Vicineum™ (oportuzumab monatox-qqrs) for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The FDA has determined that it cannot approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and has provided recommendations specific to additional clinical/statistical data and analyses in addition to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) issues pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality.

“We are deeply disappointed by this unexpected result, and it is an unfortunate day for patients suffering from BCG-unresponsive NMIBC,” said Dr. Thomas Cannell, president, and chief executive officer of Sesen Bio. “We remain dedicated to our mission to save and improve the lives of patients by bringing new treatment options to patients, and we intend to work closely with the FDA to understand next steps.”

The Company plans to request a Type A meeting as soon as possible with the FDA to discuss the next steps that are needed before the application may be approved.

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $151.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.

<b>About Vicineum™</b>

Vicineum, a locally administered fusion protein, is Sesen Bio’s lead product candidate being developed for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Vicineum is comprised of a recombinant fusion protein that targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antigens on the surface of tumor cells to deliver a potent protein payload, Pseudomonas Exotoxin A. Vicineum is constructed with a stable, genetically engineered peptide tether to ensure the payload remains attached to the antibody binding fragment until it is internalized by the cancer cell. This fusion protein design is believed to decrease the risk of toxicity to healthy tissues, thereby improving its safety. In prior clinical trials conducted by Sesen Bio, EpCAM has been shown to be overexpressed in NMIBC cells with minimal to no EpCAM expression observed on normal bladder cells. Sesen Bio is currently in the follow-up stage of a Phase 3 registration trial in the US for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In February 2021, the FDA accepted the Company’s BLA file for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and granted the application Priority Review with a target PDUFA date of August 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the Company received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding its BLA for Vicineum. Additionally, Sesen Bio believes that cancer cell-killing properties of Vicineum promote an anti-tumor immune response that may potentially combine well with immuno-oncology drugs, such as checkpoint inhibitors. For this reason, the activity of Vicineum in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is also being explored at the US National Cancer Institute in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab.

<span class=""xn-location"">INDIANAPOLIS</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Lebrikizumab led to significant improvements with at least 75 percent skin clearance in more than half of people with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), as measured by EASI, in Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lillys-lebrikizumab-significantly-improved-skin-clearance-and-itch-in-people-with-moderate-to-severe-atopic-dermatitis-in-two-phase-3-trials-301355459.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">LLY</a>) ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2 Phase 3 clinical trials. In the top-line results from these two studies of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy in AD, primary and all key secondary endpoints, including skin clearance and itch improvement, were met at Week 16. Lebrikizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds soluble IL-13 with high affinity, has high bioavailability, a long half-life and blocks IL-13 signaling.<sup> 1-4</sup> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to lebrikizumab for moderate-to-severe AD in adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg). Fast Track designation is granted for a medicine that is intended to treat a serious condition and data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.

AD, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder caused by skin barrier dysfunction and dysregulation of the immune response. People living with AD often report symptoms of intense, persistent itch which can be so uncomfortable that it can affect sleep, daily activities and social relationships. In people with AD, the IL-13 protein—a central pathogenic mediator in the disease—is overexpressed, driving multiple aspects of AD pathophysiology by promoting T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell inflammation and resulting in skin barrier dysfunction, itch, infection and hard, thickened areas of skin.<sup>5,6</sup>

""AD is a heterogenous disease with signs and symptoms varying greatly between patients, underscoring the need for additional treatment options with different mechanisms of action,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jonathan Silverberg</span>, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., associate professor of dermatology at <span class=""xn-org"">George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences</span> in <span class=""xn-location"">Washington, DC</span>, and a principal investigator of the ADvocate 2 trial. ""Data from the studies showed lebrikizumab's effect on skin clearance and its potential to address a key driver for this disease as well as provide improvements in itch, sleep disturbance and quality of life.""

Lebrikizumab also achieved key secondary endpoints versus placebo in patients with AD, including early onset in skin clearance and itch relief, improvement in interference of itch on sleep and quality of life. Key secondary endpoints were measured by the IGA, EASI, the Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale, Sleep-Loss due to Pruritus and the Dermatology Life Quality Index.

In the initial 16-week placebo-controlled period of ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs among patients treated with lebrikizumab was consistent with that of the previous Phase 2 lebrikizumab study in AD. The most common AEs included conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis and headache for lebrikizumab-treated patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were similar in the lebrikizumab group (1.4%) compared to placebo (1.7%).

""We understand the needs of people in the AD community worldwide and are aware that many are still in need of new treatment options despite available medicines,"" said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. ""Lebrikizumab is a specific inhibitor of IL-13 that offers robust binding affinity and high bioavailability. Today's results show that the inhibition of IL-13 cytokine plays a main role in AD treatment, as demonstrated by more than half of the patients achieving at least 75% clearance to total clearance on lebrikizumab monotherapy.""

The full study results from ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2 will be disclosed at future congresses in 2022. Data from a Phase 3 combination study (ADhere) of lebrikizumab with topical corticosteroids in patients with AD will be available later this year. These studies are part of the lebrikizumab Phase 3 program, which consists of five key ongoing, global studies including two monotherapy studies and a combination study as well as long-term extension (ADjoin) and adolescent open label (ADore) trials.

""We are excited about the data received from the studies that support lebrikizumab's potential efficacy in AD and by the prospect of delivering this promising therapy to people living with moderate-to-severe AD in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>,"" stated Karl Ziegelbauer, Ph.D., Almirall S.A.'s Chief Scientific Officer.

Lilly has exclusive rights for development and commercialization of lebrikizumab in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and rest of world outside <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>. Almirall has licensed the rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for the treatment of dermatology indications, including AD, in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>.

<b>About Atopic Dermatitis</b>

Atopic dermatitis (AD), or atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body.<sup>7</sup> AD is a heterogeneous disease both biologically and clinically, and may be characterized by a highly variable appearance in which flares occur in an unpredictable manner.<sup>8</sup>

Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching, which leads to an itch-scratch cycle that further damages the skin.<sup>9</sup> Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.<sup>7</sup>

<b>About Lebrikizumab</b>

Lebrikizumab is a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity to specifically prevent the formation of the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα heterodimer complex and subsequent signaling, thereby inhibiting the biological effects of IL-13 in a targeted and efficient fashion. IL-13 is believed to be a central pathogenic mediator that drives multiple aspects of the pathophysiology underlying the range of signs and symptoms of AD by promoting type 2 inflammation and mediating its effects on tissue, resulting in skin barrier dysfunction, itch, skin thickening and infection.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TICOVAC™ (tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine) for active immunization to prevent TBE in individuals 1 year of age and older.<sup>1 </sup>TICOVAC™is the only FDA-approved vaccine to help protect U.S. adults and children against the TBE virus when visiting or living in TBE endemic areas. Following today’s FDA approval, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to discuss recommendations on the safe and appropriate use of TICOVAC™.

“We are proud to deliver the first vaccine to help protect people in the U.S. against TBE, if they are traveling to any risk areas,” said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President, Vaccines, Pfizer. “This vaccine has helped to protect millions of people in TBE endemic regions since its first approval outside the U.S. 45 years ago. This authorization helps to ensure that people from the U.S. are also able to receive this vaccination if needed, reflecting our commitment to provide health for all.”

TBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,<sup>2</sup> which can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick.<sup>3</sup> Although TBE is not endemic in the U.S., to date, it has been identified in more than 35 countries across Europe and Asia.<sup>3</sup> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently recommends TBE vaccination for people who live in or are traveling to risk areas.<sup>4</sup>

More than 45 years of experience with the Pfizer TBE vaccine exist outside the U.S., and more than 170 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed since 1976.<sup>5,6</sup>

<b>About TICOVAC™ (Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine)
</b>Pfizer’s TBE vaccine, marketed under the brand names FSME-Immun<sup>®</sup> and TicoVac™ in Europe, and TICOVAC™ in the U.S., is developed using a master ‘seed’ virus that is similar to the TBE virus found in nature.<sup>7</sup> It is able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the natural TBE virus, as the sequence and structure of the virus subtype match those found in nature.<sup>8</sup>

In clinical trials, the safety and immunogenicity of TICOVAC™ were assessed across two age groups (1-15 years of age and &gt;16 years of age).<sup>6</sup> In these studies, seropositivity rates were 99.5% in 1-15 year olds and 98.7-100% in adults &gt;15 years following three doses.<sup>*</sup><sup>6,9,10</sup> Clinical studies demonstrated that TICOVAC™ was generally well-tolerated with no unexpected adverse events or vaccine-related serious adverse events observed.<sup>11,12</sup> The most common adverse reactions across both age groups were local tenderness, headache, local pain, fever, restlessness, fatigue, and muscle pain.<sup>11,12</sup> Real-world studies from Austria have shown that the vaccine is 96-98.7% effective in people who have received at least three doses of the vaccine.<sup>13,14</sup>

<b>About TBE
</b>TBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,<sup>2</sup> transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick,<sup>3</sup> and less frequently by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products from infected animals.<sup>4</sup> It may initially be mistaken for summer flu,<sup>15,16</sup> but can be a serious condition with possible long-term consequences.<sup>2,16 </sup>1 in 3 people can have long-term effects that last months or yearsincluding cognitive changes, muscle weakness or permanent paralysis,<sup>2,16</sup> and in rare cases (0.5-2%; up to 20% in Russia), people may die.<sup>17,18</sup> TBE can affect people of all ages who come into contact with ticks whenever they do outdoor activities in countries where ticks infected with TBE are prevalent.<sup>2,18</sup>

<b>U.S. Important Safety Information for TICOVAC™</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>TICOVAC should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of TICOVAC</li>
 	<li>Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of TICOVAC</li>
 	<li>Some individuals with altered immunocompetence may have reduced immune responses to TICOVAC</li>
 	<li>TICOVAC contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). No cases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed products</li>
 	<li>Vaccination with TICOVAC may not protect all vaccine recipients against tick-borne encephalitis</li>
 	<li>In clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions in subjects 1 through 15 years of age who received TICOVAC were local tenderness (18.1%), local pain (11.2%), headache (11.1%), fever (9.6%), and restlessness (9.1%)</li>
 	<li>In clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions in subjects 16 through 65 years of age who received TICOVAC were local tenderness (29.9%), local pain (13.2%), fatigue (6.6%), headache (6.3%), and muscle pain (5.1%)</li>
 	<li>Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pregnant women</li>

<span class=""xn-location"">KIRKLAND, QC</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 13, 2021</span> /CNW/ - Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to Health Canada for molnupiravir, an investigational twice daily oral antiviral agent currently in trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Merck is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

The rolling submission process was accepted under the Minister of Health's Interim Order, which allows for the review of early safety, quality and efficacy data while later-stage clinical trials take place. Further findings from the ongoing molnupiravir development program will be shared with Health Canada as they become available. Health <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> will make a decision only when all necessary evidence has been submitted and reviewed.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Phase 2 interim results from the Phase 2/3 MOVe-OUT clinical trials were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in July. Phase 3 of the trial, evaluating molnupiravir twice daily for five days in non-hospitalized adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, five days or less following symptom onset and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes, is underway and includes sites in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>.

<b>About the MOVe-OUT study<br class=""dnr"" /></b>MOVe-OUT (MK-4482-002) is a Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study evaluating orally administered molnupiravir in non-hospitalized participants at least 18 years of age with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within five days prior to randomization. The trial plans to enroll a total of 1,850 participants with mild or moderate COVID-19. A total of 1,550 patients in the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be randomized 1:1 to receive either molnupiravir (800 mg) or placebo twice daily for five days. The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate efficacy of molnupiravir compared to placebo as assessed by the percentage of participants who are hospitalized and/or die during the period from randomization through Day 29. For further information regarding the trial please visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3259497-1&amp;h=693142206&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3DNCT04575597%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;a=clinicaltrials.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT04575597).

CRANBURY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: RCKT), a clinical-stage company advancing an integrated and sustainable pipeline of genetic therapies for rare childhood disorders, today announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the clinical hold on the Company’s Phase 1 clinical trial of RP-A501 for the treatment of Danon Disease, allowing patient enrollment to resume. The hold was removed after the Company addressed the FDA’s requests to modify the trial protocol and other supporting documents with revised guidelines for patient selection and management. The Company has initiated steps to resume the program as soon as possible and expects to commence dosing in the low-dose (6.7e13 vg/kg) pediatric patient cohort in the third quarter.

“We are grateful for the collaboration between the FDA and our team in reaching agreement on protocol updates allowing us to resume patient enrollment in our Danon Disease trial. We look forward to progressing this critical work on behalf of all Danon patients,” said Gaurav Shah, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Pharma. “We are moving as quickly as possible to resume dosing and commence treatment this quarter. Additionally, given the activity observed among young adults in our low-dose cohort, in agreement with the FDA, we are now proceeding with the pediatric cohort. This is another important step forward as we believe the pediatric Danon population has the potential to realize the maximum benefit from our Danon Disease gene therapy program. We continue to anticipate reporting updated longer-term data from the low-dose (6.7e13 vg/kg) and higher-dose (1.1e14 vg/kg) young adult cohorts in the fourth quarter.”

Rocket’s Danon Disease program was placed on clinical hold by the FDA in May of 2021 to modify the study protocol and other supporting documents with revised guidelines for patient selection and safety management. No new drug-related safety events were observed in the low-dose or higher-dose young adult cohorts as part of the clinical hold or during the hold.

The non-randomized, open-label Phase 1 trial is designed to enroll both pediatric and young adult male patients to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of RP-A501. Additional outcome measures include cardiomyocyte and skeletal muscle transduction by gene expression, histologic correction via endomyocardial biopsy and clinical stabilization via cardiac imaging and functional cardiopulmonary testing.

<b>About RP-A501</b>

RP-A501 is an investigational gene therapy product being developed for Danon Disease and the first potential gene therapy for monogenic heart failure. It consists of a recombinant adeno-associated serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid containing a functional version of the human <i>LAMP2B</i> transgene (AAV9.<i>LAMP2B</i>). RP-A501 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, in which the Company observed preliminary activity data of RP-A501 as well as a favorable tolerability profile.

<b>About Danon Disease</b>

Danon Disease is a rare X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2), an important mediator of autophagy. This results in accumulation of autophagosomes and glycogen, particularly in cardiac muscle and other tissues, which ultimately leads to heart failure, and for many male patients, death during adolescence or early adulthood. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 15,000 to 30,000 patients in the U.S. and the Europe. The only available treatment option for Danon Disease is cardiac transplantation, which is associated with substantial complications and is not considered curative. There are no specific therapies available for the treatment of Danon Disease.

These designations are important for 2 reasons</em><ul><li><em>First, they provide external validation of the clinical data. Regulatory designations such as the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation, or RMAT, the European Orphan Drug Designation, or the European Medicines Agency Priority Medicines Scheme or PRIME, require clear clinical evidence, demonstrating the ability to either address an unmet medical need or some advantage over available therapies. Only promising therapies receive these designations.</em></li><li><em>Second, these designations enable expedited drug development through several incentives. These incentives include expedited reviews of marketing applications and enhance interactions with regulatory authorities, including formal meetings.&nbsp;</em></li></ul></li><li><em>In addition to these regulatory designations, the clinical evidence from the Phase I trial allowed us to initiate the Phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial.

INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded label for Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: LLY) rapid-acting insulin, Lyumjev<sup>®</sup> (insulin lispro-aabc injection) 100 units/mL indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, to include administration via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with an insulin pump.

Lyumjev, a novel formulation of insulin lispro developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels, was approved by the FDA in June 2020. As a rapid-acting mealtime insulin, Lyumjev helps control blood sugar levels after meals in adults with diabetes, similar to how natural insulin works after meals in people without diabetes.

""Insulin pumps are an important delivery option for people with diabetes – many of whom struggle with high postmeal blood sugar levels,"" said Leonard Glass M.D., F.A.C.E., vice president of Medical Affairs, Lilly. ""The expansion of the Lyumjev label to include use in an insulin pump provides a new and important choice for people with diabetes. It is an exciting development for pump users seeking to manage their blood sugar levels and reduce postmeal spikes.""

The approval was based on results from PRONTO-PUMP-2, a phase 3 treat-to-target study that confirmed the efficacy and safety of Lyumjev when used in insulin pumps in adults with type 1 diabetes. The study met the primary endpoint of noninferior A1C reduction from baseline to week 16 compared to Humalog. Lyumjev demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog.<sup>1</sup>

Lyumjev is available in the U.S. and in several global markets, including Japan and the European Union, where it is also approved for use in insulin pumps. People with diabetes should seek guidance from their healthcare providers and refer to the insulin pump maker instructions to see if Lyumjev U-100 can be used with their pump.

<b>About the PRONTO-PUMP-2 Study
</b>PRONTO-PUMP-2 was a phase 3, 16-week, randomized (1:1), active controlled, double-blind treat-to-target multinational study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Lyumjev versus Humalog (insulin lispro injection) 100 units/mL in 432 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using insulin pumps. Following a 2-week lead-in period, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to either Lyumjev (n=215) or Humalog (n=217), both 100 units/mL. Patients were instructed to deliver bolus doses 0-2 minutes before meals. The primary objective was noninferiority (noninferiority margin [NIM]=0.4% for A1C) of Lyumjev to Humalog on change in A1C from baseline to week 16. Key multiplicity-adjusted secondary objectives included superiority of Lyumjev to Humalog at week 16 for 1- and 2-hour postprandial glucose during a meal test and duration of time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during daytime and over a 24-hour period.<sup>1</sup>

<b>PURPOSE and SAFETY SUMMARY
</b><b>Important Facts About </b><b>LYUMJEV<sup>®</sup> (LOOM-jehv) and </b><b>Humalog<sup>®</sup> (HU-ma-log)</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Lyumjev is also known as insulin lispro-aabc injection. Humalog is also known as insulin lispro injection.</li>
 	<li>Lyumjev is a fast-acting insulin. Lyumjev is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin. Humalog is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. Lyumjev and Humalog are available only with a prescription.</li>
 	<li>Lyumjev comes in two strengths: U-100 (100 units per milliliter) and U-200 (200 units per milliliter). Lyumjev U-200 contains <b>2 times as much insulin </b>in 1 milliliter as Lyumjev U-100. Humalog U-100 contains 100 units of insulin per milliliter. The dose window of the pen shows the number of insulin units to be delivered.</li>
 	<li>It is not known if Lyumjev is safe and effective for children. It is not known if Humalog is safe and effective for children with type 2 diabetes or for children younger than 3 years of age with type 1 diabetes as there were no studies done with Humalog in these groups of children. If your doctor decides to give your child any insulin products, he or she may give you special instructions.</li>
</ul>
<b>All Lyumjev and Humalog products contain insulin lispro.  </b>

<b>Warnings</b>

<b>Do not take Lyumjev or Humalog if you have:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li>
 	<li>an allergy to insulin lispro-aabc, Humalog, or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev or Humalog.</li>
</ul>
<b>Do not reuse needles or share your insulin injection supplies with other people. This includes your:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>prefilled pen for use by a single patient</li>
 	<li>cartridges</li>
 	<li>reusable pen that works with Lilly 3mL cartridges available for Humalog</li>
 	<li>needles</li>
 	<li>syringes</li>
</ul>
<b>You or the other person can get a serious infection. This can happen even if you change the needle. </b>

<b>Do not</b> change the type of insulin you take or your dose, unless your doctor tells you to. This could cause low or high blood sugar, which could be serious.

<b>Do not</b> use a syringe to remove Lyumjev or Humalog from your prefilled pen. This can cause you to take too much insulin. Taking too much insulin can lead to severe low blood sugar. This may result in seizures or death.

<b>Lyumjev and Humalog may cause serious side effects. Some of these can lead to death.</b> The possible serious side effects are:

 	<li><b>Heart failure.</b> Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or ""TZDs,"" with Lyumjev or Humalog may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with Lyumjev or Humalog. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.</li>
 	<li><b>Sudden onset of high blood sugar and high amounts of ketones in your blood or urine.</b> You can have these serious side effects when your insulin pump or infusion set is not working the right way, if there are handling errors, or if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, you may not get the right amount of insulin, so always keep extra insulin and injection supplies with you.</li>

<b>Before using</b>

Talk with your doctor about low blood sugar and how to manage it. Also tell your doctor:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.</li>
 	<li>about any other prescription medicines you take, especially ones called TZDs.</li>
 	<li>about all of your medical conditions, including if you have heart failure or other heart, liver, or kidney problems.</li>
 	<li>if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.</li>
</ul>
<b>How to take</b>

Read the <b>Instructions for Use</b> that come with your <b>Lyumjev or</b> <b>Humalog</b>. Be sure to take your <b>Lyumjev or Humalog</b> and <b>check your blood sugar levels</b> exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to change your dose because of illness, increased stress, or changes in your weight, diet, or physical activity level. He or she may also tell you to change the amount or time of your dose because of other medicines or different types of insulin you take.

<b>Before injecting your Lyumjev or Humalog</b>

You can inject your insulin dose yourself, or you can have a trained caregiver inject it for you. Make sure you or your caregiver:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Check the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.</li>
 	<li>Use a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you reuse needles.</li>
 	<li>Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. <b>Do not</b> inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. <b>Avoid</b> injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.</li>
</ul>
<b>When you are ready to inject</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Inject Lyumjev under your skin at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.</li>
 	<li>Inject Humalog under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.</li>
</ul>
<b>Staying safe while taking your Lyumjev or Humalog</b>

To stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to <b>never</b> inject Lyumjev U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump.  Also be sure <b>not to</b>:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>mix Lyumjev with other insulins or liquids</li>
 	<li>drive or use heavy machinery until you know how your Lyumjev or Humalog affects you.</li>
 	<li>drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol when taking your Lyumjev or Humalog.</li>
</ul>

WILMINGTON, Del. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and InnoCare (HKEX: 09969) today announced that Incyte and a subsidiary of InnoCare have entered into a collaboration and license agreement for the development and commercialization of tafasitamab, a humanized Fc-modified cytolytic CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody, in Greater China.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Under the terms of the agreement, InnoCare will pay Incyte US$35 million up front, and Incyte is eligible to receive up to an additional US$82.5 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties.

InnoCare will receive the rights to develop and exclusively commercialize tafasitamab in hematology and oncology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

“The collaboration with InnoCare allows us to accelerate the expansion of our partnered portfolio in China,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. “We believe InnoCare will be an excellent partner to accelerate the development of tafasitamab, and if approved, help bring this innovative therapy to patients and healthcare providers in Greater China.”

“We are honored and excited to partner with Incyte, and are committed to making tafasitamab, an FDA-approved treatment, available to eligible patients in Greater China, upon approval. The strategic collaboration with Incyte will not only enhance our strength in the field of hematology and oncology, but also offer us good opportunity to explore the potential clinical benefit of our BTK inhibitor orelabrutinib in combination with tafasitamab,” said Dr. Jasmine Cui, Co-founder, Chairwoman and CEO of InnoCare. “In addition, we believe that tafasitamab, an innovative CD19 antibody, is critical to solidifying our long-term strategy to strengthen our large molecule capabilities and to enhance combinational therapies with our existing pipelines.”

The transaction is effective immediately upon the execution of the collaboration and license agreement.

<b>About Tafasitamab</b>

Tafasitamab is a humanized Fc-modified cytolytic CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody. In 2010, MorphoSys licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize tafasitamab from Xencor, Inc. Tafasitamab incorporates an XmAb<sup>®</sup> engineered Fc domain, which mediates B-cell lysis through apoptosis and immune effector mechanism including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).

Monjuvi<sup>® </sup>(tafasitamab-cxix) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

In January 2020, MorphoSys and Incyte entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement to further develop and commercialize tafasitamab globally. Monjuvi<sup>®</sup> is being co-commercialized by Incyte and MorphoSys in the United States. Incyte has exclusive commercialization rights outside the United States.

In June 2021, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorization of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide, followed by tafasitamab monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The CHMP opinion is currently being reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant marketing authorization for medicinal products in the European Union (EU).

Tafasitamab is being clinically investigated as a therapeutic option in B-cell malignancies in a number of ongoing combination trials.

Monjuvi<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of MorphoSys AG.

XmAb<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Xencor, Inc.

ALAMEDA, Calif. &amp; MADISON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 16, 2021-- Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) and Invenra, Inc. today announced that they have expanded their discovery and licensing collaboration to include an additional 20 oncology targets. The augmented partnership builds on the two companies’ ongoing collaboration and license agreement to discover and develop mono-specific and multi-specific antibodies for incorporation into novel biologics to treat cancer, which was originally announced in May 2018 and expanded in October 2019.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005189/en/</p>
“We’re very pleased with the successful relationship we’ve had with Invenra to-date and look forward to expanding our existing collaboration to include additional oncology targets,” said Peter Lamb, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Scientific Strategy and Chief Scientific Officer of Exelixis. “As Exelixis seeks to build a differentiated next-generation pipeline in oncology, we’re leveraging Invenra’s expertise in antibody and bispecific discovery to provide key building blocks for potential future Exelixis biologics, including antibody-drug conjugates.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 16, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's Amplatzer™ Amulet™ Left Atrial Appendage Occluder to treat people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) who are at risk of ischemic stroke. The device offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) – an area where blood clots can form in people suffering from AFib – reducing their risk of stroke and immediately eliminating the need for blood-thinning medication.

The LAA is a small pouch connected to the upper left chamber of the heart. For people with AFib – the most common of the persistent arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats – the heart's ability to effectively pump blood can be disrupted, allowing blood to pool and collect in the LAA causing an increased risk for clotting. If clots reach the blood stream, they can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. For patients with AFib who are unable to take blood-thinning medication long term, physicians may opt for occlusion (or closure) of the LAA through a minimally invasive procedure using devices like Abbott's Amulet to seal off the LAA entirely and reduce the risk of stroke.

""As the world's population continues to age, we're seeing a surge in atrial fibrillation cases, and with that comes increased risk of stroke,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy</span>, M.D., Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute at HCA Midwest Health, who served as principal investigator for the study that led to FDA approval. ""The approval of Abbott's Amulet device provides physicians with a treatment option that reduces the risk of stroke and eliminates the need for blood-thinning medication immediately after the procedure, which is incredibly valuable given the bleeding risks associated with these medicines.""

Before this approval, the only minimally invasive option for LAA occlusion for U.S. physicians and their patients was a solution with a single component to seal the LAA that requires blood-thinning drugs to heal and additional patient monitoring to ensure closure. In contrast, Abbott's Amulet uses dual-seal technology to completely and immediately seal the LAA. Amulet recipients do not need to use blood-thinning medication following the procedure. Additionally, the device can treat a broad range of anatomies and has the widest range of occluder sizes on the market; it is also recapturable and repositionable to ensure optimal placement.

""Amulet's unique dual-seal approach has made it the number one LAA closure product in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, so today's device approval by the FDA is an important milestone in allowing us to bring this treatment option to American physicians and patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael Dale</span>, senior vice president of Abbott's structural heart business. ""Consistent with our mission purpose, our minimally invasive Amulet procedure for reducing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation will help people live better lives through better health.""

<b>About Amplatzer Amulet
</b>The Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder has been approved for use in more than 80 countries, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>, since its initial CE Mark approval in 2013. The FDA approval is supported by findings from the Amulet IDE trial, a large-scale randomized head-to-head study comparing Amulet with an alternative minimally invasive LAA occlusion device, which will be virtually presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2021 Congress on <span class=""xn-chron"">August 30, 2021</span>.

<strong>Basel, August 17, </strong><strong>2021</strong> –  Novartis today announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has further approved Cosentyx<sup>®</sup> (secukinumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients (six years and older with a body weight ≥50 kg) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, making it the only interleukin inhibitor approved in China for these patients. Cosentyx is already approved in China for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults and adult ankylosing spondylitis. The approval is based on two Phase III international studies in pediatric patients aged 6 to &lt; 18 years old, which showed that Cosentyx was as safe in children and adolescents as when used in adults<sup>7,8</sup>.

“Psoriasis goes beyond skin symptoms. If left untreated it can become a source of embarrassment, affecting a young person’s self-esteem. The approval in China of Cosentyx means we are able to help even more children and adults around the world live their lives to the fullest, by providing them with a safe and effective therapy they can trust,” said Todd Fox, Novartis Global Medical Franchise, Head of Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology. “With further US and European filings for childhood arthritic conditions, we have taken another step in our ambition to expand Cosentyx to 10 indications over the next 10 years as part of our commitment to immuno-dermatology and rheumatology.”

This approval in China follows recent approval of Cosentyx in the United States and Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients six years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

Novartis is committed to making Cosentyx available to young patients who may benefit from the therapy and has recently filed for US and European regulatory approval for Cosentyx as a potential treatment in juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), two subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Currently, there are very limited approved treatment options for JIA, and only a minority of patients go on to achieve and maintain an inactive disease state.

Cosentyx is backed by more than 14 years of clinical experience and long-term five-year clinical data across three indications of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (AS), as well as real-world evidence<sup>3-5</sup>. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across AS, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 500,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch<sup>6</sup>.

<strong>About psoriasis</strong>
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects more than 125 million people worldwide<sup>9</sup>, potentially impacting up to 350,000 children<sup>1</sup>. One-third of psoriasis cases begin in childhood, and of these, the onset is most common during adolescence<sup>2</sup>.

<strong>About Cosentyx</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (secukinumab)</strong>
Cosentyx is the first and only fully human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)<sup>4,10,11</sup>. Cosentyx is the only biologic with proven efficacy in all six key manifestations of PsA<sup>4,12,13</sup>.

This pediatric psoriasis approval in China is for 150 mg Cosentyx given by injection every four weeks for children with a body weight of at least 50 kg. After initial counseling and proper training in the injection technique, Cosentyx can be given by a child’s parent or carer at home. Cosentyx is also approved in China for treating adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or ankylosing spondylitis.

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated its Type II Variation Marketing Authorization Applications (MAA) for both <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) in combination with <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) and <i>Opdivo </i>in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy as first-line treatments for adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Validation of these applications confirm that the submissions are complete and begins the EMA’s centralized review process.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Outcomes for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemotherapy alone remain poor, and there is a clear need for additional options beyond this long-standing standard of care,” said Ian M. Waxman, M.D., development lead, gastrointestinal cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “The validation of our applications moves us a step closer to potentially bringing these two <i>Opdivo</i>-based regimens to patients in the EU who may benefit.”

The applications are based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 CheckMate -648 trial, in which both <i>Opdivo</i>-based treatment combinations — <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> and <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy — demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit compared to chemotherapy at the pre-specified interim analysis in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%, as well as in the all-randomized population. <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> is the first dual immunotherapy combination to demonstrate a superior survival benefit versus chemotherapy in this setting. The safety profiles of <i>Opdivo</i> and chemotherapy and of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> were consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual components.

Results from CheckMate -648 were presented in an oral session during the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and were selected for the official ASCO press program.

Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -648 trial.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -648</span></b>

CheckMate -648 is a randomized Phase 3 study evaluating <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Yervoy </i>or <i>Opdivo</i> plus fluorouracil and cisplatin against fluorouracil plus cisplatin alone in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 ≥1% for both <i>Opdivo</i>-based combinations versus chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of the trial include OS and PFS by BICR in the all-randomized population.

In the <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i> arm, patients received treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and <i>Yervoy</i> 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the <i>Opdivo</i> plus chemotherapy arm, patients received treatment with <i>Opdivo</i> 240 mg on Day 1 and Day 15, fluorouracil 800 mg/m²/day on Day 1 through Day 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m² on Day 1 of four-week cycle. Patients received <i>Opdivo</i> for up to 24 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Esophageal Cancer</span></b>

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of death from cancer worldwide, with approximately 600,000 new cases and over 540,000 deaths in 2020. The two most common types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, which account for approximately 85% and 15% of all esophageal cancers, respectively, though esophageal tumor histology can vary by region with the highest rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma occurring in Asia (~95%), Europe (~65%) and North America (35%).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>

<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Yervoy</i></span></b>

<i>Yervoy</i> is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. <i>Yervoy</i> binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <i>Yervoy</i> 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. <i>Yervoy</i> is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for <i>Yervoy</i> spanning multiple tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis.

In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

63534,PharmaShots Interview: Janssen’s Andrew Greenspan Shares Insight About the New AGA Guidelines Recommending Stelara (Ustekinumab) as a First-Line Treatment Option in Crohn's Disease,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with PharmaShots, Andrew Greenspan, VP, Immunology Affairs at Janssen shared his views on the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of moderate-to-severe Crohnâ€™s disease and also highlighted about Janssenâ€™s efforts in improving the QoL of patients with CD</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The AGA guidelines assessed the overall benefit of each drug and also compared drugs via a network meta-analysis to assess their efficacy and recommended anti-TNF agents or ustekinumab and suggested vedolizumab as a first-line treatment</li><li>Ustekinumab or vedolizumab has been recommended by AGA in patients who have previously not responded to anti-TNF agents</li><li>The new AGA guidelines did not recommend the biologic natalizumab any further due to potential AEs and the availability of safer treatment options</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of Crohnâ€™s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) regularly reviews its clinical guidelines for accuracy, relevance, and clinical impact in order to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to help guide clinical practice decisions; recently, it&nbsp;published&nbsp;its new clinical guidelines recommending therapies for the management of luminal and fistulizing Crohnâ€™s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Crohnâ€™s disease is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans and 2.5 million Europeans. Crohnâ€™s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause or cure.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The organization evaluated the overall benefit and efficacy of available biologic therapies against one another for these guidelines, including assessment of the use of thiopurines, methotrexate, and antiâ€“tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a biologic drugs for the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory Crohnâ€™s disease.</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At Janssen, we are proud that the AGAâ€™s new guidelines highlight STELARA</em><em>Â® (ustekinumab) as a recommended first-line treatment option, especially for those who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. We believe this guideline supports the safety, efficacy&nbsp;and durability STELARA offers people living with Crohnâ€™s disease, as well as Janssenâ€™s goal of making STELARA the worldwide standard of care in IBD.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key takeaways of AGA guidelines updates.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The main takeaway of the updated AGA guidelines is that biologics are noted as the most effective treatments for the management of Crohnâ€™s disease, with STELARA recommended as a first-line treatment option, especially for patients who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. The recommendation can be attributed to the vast body of clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of STELARA and is a vote of confidence for an additional advanced treatment for people living with Crohnâ€™s disease around the world and the physicians who treat them.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association&nbsp;highlights that biologics should be used early in a patientâ€™s treatment journey, rather than delaying their use until after failure of mesalamine and/or corticosteroids, in patients with moderate to severe or fistulizing Crohnâ€™s disease. The guidelines also highlight anti-TNF agents for the management of Crohnâ€™s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What is the importance of these guidelines for patients with Crohnâ€™s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>People living with Crohnâ€™s disease deserve safe, effective, and convenient therapeutic options that can provide both rapid response and lasting remission. Adding to the body of evidence for these options helps us evaluate what may be the best choice for a particular person, especially as we see new advances, like biologic treatments, continuing to offer patients relief from the symptoms of moderate to severe Crohnâ€™s disease.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>As Janssen strives to provide safe and effective treatment options, we support the&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Associationâ€™s&nbsp;commitment to keep its members, patients, and the public at large apprised of the most current best practices, through regular review of its clinical guidelines, to&nbsp;provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations and to&nbsp;achieve the highest possible quality of patient care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the treatment goals for Crohnâ€™s disease?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>As individuals with immune-mediated diseases often undergo long treatment journeys and can suffer for years before receiving an advanced or proper treatment, Iâ€™m always energized by the Janssen teamâ€™s work to drive innovation every day and help those living with these diseases.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This is especially true in the area of Crohnâ€™s disease; as there is currently no cure for Crohnâ€™s disease, a focus on clinical response, preventing flare-ups of symptoms, and remission is paramount when considering a patientâ€™s treatment goals.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study designs and outcomes from the SEAVUE study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Until now, there were no head-to-head trials comparing the safety and efficacy of the leading prescription biologics that treat Crohnâ€™s disease. In the absence of direct head-to-head evidence, a multitude of indirect comparisons are often used to evaluate therapiesâ€”this can create uncertainty among physicians when determining which course of treatment may be best for their Crohnâ€™s disease patients in the first-line setting.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To help physicians and patients make more informed treatment choices, we boldly conducted the first head-to-head Crohnâ€™s disease trial in bio-naÃ¯ve patients with STELARA and adalimumab therapies; namely, SEAVUE was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, active-controlled study in adult patients with Crohnâ€™s disease.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>The primary endpoint was clinical remission at 52 weeks defined as a CD Activity Index (CDAI) &lt;150.</em></li><li><em>Major secondary endpoints were:</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Corticosteroid-free remission</em></li><li><em>Clinical response =100-point CDAI decrease from baseline</em></li><li><em>Remission in patient reported CDAI components (PRO-2 symptom remission: abdominal pain (AP) mean daily score =1 and stool frequency (SF) mean daily number =3)</em></li><li><em>Endoscopic remission (SES-CD score =3/0 for pts with BL score=3) at week 52</em></li><li><em>Clinical remission at week 16</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>While STELARA did not achieve statistical separation from adalimumab in the trial, it demonstrated high rates of clinical efficacy and clinical remission.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What were the key points of the abstracts presented at DDW 2021?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The SEAVUE data showed treatment with STELARA demonstrated high rates of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical response, and endoscopic response through one year in biologic-naÃ¯ve patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease. However, it did not demonstrate statistical separation from adalimumab.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>STELARA-treated patients experienced a 64.9 percent clinical remission rate at one year, with adalimumab at 61 percent.</em></li><li><em>The majority of patients (60.7 percent) achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission with STELARA at one year (57.4 percent with adalimumab).</em></li><li><em>STELARA achieved 72.3 percent clinical response rate at week 52 (adalimumab at 66.2 percent).</em></li><li><em>Results for STELARA (56.5 percent) and adalimumab (55.4 percent) achieved PRO-2 symptom remission.</em></li><li><em>At week 16, 57.1 percent of STELARA-treated patients achieved clinical remission (60 percent for adalimumab-treated patients).</em></li><li><em>The trialâ€™s discontinuation rates prior to week 52 were 15.2 percent for STELARA-treated patients (and 23.6 percent for adalimumab-treated patients).</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Discontinuation due to adverse events were 6.3 percent for STELARA-treated patients and 11.3 percent for adalimumab-treated patients, respectively.</em></li><li><em>Adverse events were consistent with STELARAâ€™s established safety profile.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss Janssenâ€™s efforts to improve the QoL of patients with CD.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Janssen is committed to relentlessly advancing care for those living with chronic, difficult-to-manage immune-mediated diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, encompassing Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a key area of focus for Janssen. Since introducing the first TNF inhibitor to the market in 1998 for the treatment of Crohnâ€™s disease, we changed the inflammatory bowel disease treatment paradigm and remain focused in this disease area.</em></p>

<p><em>At Janssen, we are investing significantly in R&amp;D to usher in a new era of treatment for these diseases; we also continue to generate new scientific evidence for our current portfolio of leading treatments. While we are invested in the scientific and medical innovation, our prioritization of the patient journey does not stop there.

</ul>
NESS ZIONA, Israel, July 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sol-Gel Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SLGL), a dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases, today announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its first proprietary drug product, TWYNEO (tretinoin/benzoyl peroxide) cream, 0.1%/3%, indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. TWYNEO uses Sol-Gel’s patented technology to entrap tretinoin, a retinoid, and benzoyl peroxide within silica-based microcapsules to stabilize tretinoin from being degraded by benzoyl peroxide and to slowly release each of the active drug ingredients over time to provide a favorable efficacy and safety profile. TWYNEO is patent protected until 2038. Sol-Gel has partnered with Galderma to commercialize TWYNEO in the U.S. Sol-Gel expects to receive a regulatory milestone payment in conjunction with this approval and retains the option to regain U.S. commercialization rights five years following first commercialization in the U.S.

“The FDA approval of TWYNEO underscores our ability to deliver innovative, proprietary drugs to the market,” stated Dr. Alon Seri-Levy, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sol-Gel. “Based on the clinical data observed, we believe that TWYNEO has the potential to change the treatment landscape for the tens of millions of patients suffering from acne vulgaris. With market leader, Galderma, handling the product launch of TWYNEO, we are excited that TWYNEO will soon be available to patients in the U.S.,” continued Dr. Seri-Levy. “We remain focused on obtaining FDA approval of EPSOLAY<sup>®</sup> (benzoyl peroxide), our other Galderma-partnered product – the approval of which has been delayed due to FDA’s COVID-19-related restrictions. We are also making progress on our innovative earlier stage programs for erlotinib, roflumilast and tapinarof with the intent of advancing them into the clinic,” he concluded.

“Galderma was founded forty years ago around a commitment to serve the dermatological needs of healthcare professionals and their patients,” said Baldo Scassellati Sforzolini, Global Head of Research &amp; Development at Galderma. “Our heritage in acne dates back to our founding and we are excited to partner with Sol-Gel to bring yet another acne innovation to market for a condition that impacts up to 50 million Americans annually.<sup>1</sup>”

“TWYNEO combines, for the first time, two of the most commonly used topical agents available for the treatment of acne into a single application. Due to stability issues, these products don’t play well together, and we were never able to recommend even consecutive co-application of the two agents. Sol-Gel’s technology has solved this problem,” said Hilary Baldwin, M.D., Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine, Medical Director, The Acne Treatment and Research Center and Past President of the American Acne and Rosacea Society. “The approval of TWYNEO offers patients efficacy with these two products in a single convenient application. I believe physicians will look forward to adding TWYNEO to their acne treatments toolbox.”

The New Drug Application (NDA) for TWYNEO was approved by the FDA on July 26, 2021. The NDA was supported by positive results from two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center studies (NCT03761784, and NCT03761810), in which TWYNEO demonstrated efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in subjects nine years of age and older with facial acne vulgaris. TWYNEO is the first FDA-approved fixed-dose combination of tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide.

<strong>About Acne Vulgaris</strong>
Acne vulgaris is a common multifactorial skin disease that according to the American Academy of Dermatology affects up to 50 million people in the U.S. The disease occurs most frequently during childhood and adolescence (affecting 80% to 85% of all adolescents) but it may also appear in adults. Acne vulgaris patients suffer from the appearance of lesions on areas of the body with a large concentration of oil glands, such as the face, chest, neck and back. These lesions can be inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) or non-inflamed (comedones). Acne vulgaris can have a profound effect on the quality of life of those suffering from the disease. In addition to carrying a substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, the appearance of lesions may cause psychological strain, social withdrawal and lowered self-esteem.

<strong>About TWYNEO
</strong>TWYNEO is a topical cream containing a fixed‑dose combination of tretinoin, 0.1%, and benzoyl peroxide, 3%, for the treatment of acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. TWYNEO is the first acne treatment that contains a fixed‑dose combination of benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin. Tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide are widely prescribed separately for acne vulgaris; however, benzoyl peroxide causes degradation of the tretinoin molecule, thereby potentially reducing its effectiveness if used at the same time or combined in the same formulation. The formulation of TWYNEO uses silica (silicon dioxide) core shell structures to separately micro-encapsulate tretinoin crystals and benzoyl peroxide crystals enabling inclusion of the two active ingredients in the cream.

<strong>Indications and Usage</strong>
TWYNEO is a combination of tretinoin, a retinoid, and benzoyl peroxide indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients 9 years of age and older.
<strong>

<span class=""xn-location"">LONDON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 17, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) plc today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new indication for JEMPERLI (dostarlimab-gxly), a programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody, for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication received accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

<b>Dr <span class=""xn-person"">Hal Barron</span>, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said:</b> ""For patients with tumors expressing the dMMR biomarker, there continues to be a significant need for new and effective treatments. I'm excited about GSK's second oncology FDA approval this year, and the new treatment option it provides for these patients.""

Mismatch repair-deficient tumors contain abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA when copied in a cell.<sup>i</sup> In the US, prevalence of dMMR across patients with solid tumors has been estimated at 14%.<sup>ii</sup><sup>  </sup>Mismatch repair-deficient status is a biomarker that has been shown to predict response to immune checkpoint blockade with PD-1 therapy.<sup>iii,iv</sup> Tumors with this biomarker are most commonly found in endometrial, colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers, but may also be found in other solid tumors.<sup>i,ii,v</sup>

<b>Dr Jubilee Brown, Professor and Division Director of Gynecologic Oncology at Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, and investigator on the GARNET study, said:</b> ""JEMPERLI is an important new treatment option for patients with mismatch repair-deficient recurrent or advanced solid cancers who have progressed and have no alternative options. As we saw in the GARNET trial, of those patients who respond to treatment with JEMPERLI, nearly all continued to respond for six months or longer.""

This new indication follows an FDA priority review of the Biologics License Application and is based on the collective results from the dMMR endometrial cancer cohort A1 and the dMMR solid-tumor (non-endometrial cancer) cohort F of the ongoing GARNET trial. The GARNET trial is a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-cohort, open-label study. Cohort F included patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced non-endometrial cancers, with the highest prevalence in colorectal, small intestine and stomach cancers.

The major efficacy outcomes of the GARNET trial are objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as assessed against RECIST v 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Results in all dMMR solid tumors, including endometrial and non-endometrial solid tumors (n=209), demonstrated an ORR of 41.6% (95% CI; 34.9-48.6) with a complete response rate of 9.1% and a partial response rate of 32.5%. The median DoR was 34.7 months (range 2.6-35.8+) with 95.4% of patients maintaining a response for six months or longer. In the dMMR solid tumor non-endometrial cancer cohort (n=106), results demonstrated an ORR of 38.7% (95% CI; 29.4-48.6).

Patients received 500 mg of dostarlimab as an intravenous infusion once every three weeks for four doses, followed by 1,000 mg once every six weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 267 patients with recurrent or advanced dMMR solid tumors who were evaluable for safety, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue/asthenia (42%), anemia (30%), diarrhea (25%) and nausea (22%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥2%) were anemia, fatigue/asthenia, increased transaminases, sepsis and acute kidney injury. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) included decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, increased alkaline phosphatase and decreased albumin.

In <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2021</span>, the FDA granted accelerated approval for JEMPERLI for the treatment of adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. This approval was based on data from cohort A1, which included 71 patients with dMMR endometrial cancer.

With the dMMR solid-tumor approval, the US prescribing information for this indication includes efficacy data for an additional 32 patients in the endometrial cancer cohort A1 (n=103). The additional results for this cohort show an ORR of 44.7% (95% CI; 34.9-54.8) with a DoR range of 2.6-35.8+ months. The results of the endometrial cancer cohort of the GARNET trial represent the largest dataset to date evaluating an anti-PD-1 as monotherapy treatment for women with endometrial cancer.

As we work to expand our oncology pipeline and portfolio of cancer treatments, GSK is also studying JEMPERLI in earlier lines of treatment for endometrial cancer and in combination with other therapeutic agents for patients with advanced/metastatic cancers beyond endometrial cancer.

<b>About GARNET<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The ongoing phase I GARNET trial is evaluating dostarlimab as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Part <span class=""xn-money"">2B</span> of the study includes five expansion cohorts: dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer (cohort A1), mismatch repair proficient/microsatellite stable (MMRp/MSS) endometrial cancer (cohort A2), non-small cell lung cancer (cohort E), dMMR/MSI-H non-endometrial or POLE-mut solid tumor basket cohort (cohort F), and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer without <i>BRCA </i>mutations (cohort G). Patients enrolled in cohort A1 needed to have progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, whereas, patients enrolled in cohort F needed to have progressed following systemic therapy and had no satisfactory alternative treatment options; patients with colorectal cancer must have had progressive disease after, or have been intolerant to, a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.

<b>About Mismatch Repair Deficiency<br class=""dnr"" /></b>In normal cells, mismatch repair (MMR) is a process that corrects errors introduced during DNA replication via enzymes. Under normal conditions, the enzymes as part of the MMR system restore DNA integrity by detecting and fixing the erroneous strands.<sup>vi</sup> When this repair mechanism is defective, it is known as mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR). DMMR is the result of the enzymes no longer functioning properly, leading to errors in the DNA that go unchecked. A dMMR system may result in the accumulation of these errors and may lead to cancer.<sup>i,vi</sup> According to results from a structured literature review and meta-analysis investigating pooled prevalence estimates of dMMR across solid tumors, prevalence of dMMR across solid tumors in the US has been estimated at 14%.<sup>ii</sup>

<b>About JEMPERLI (dostarlimab-gxly)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>JEMPERLI is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.<sup>vii </sup>In addition to GARNET, JEMPERLI is being investigated in other registrational enabling studies, as monotherapy and as part of combination regimens, including in women with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial cancer, women with stage III or IV non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, and in patients with other advanced solid tumors or metastatic cancers.

JEMPERLI was discovered by AnaptysBio and licensed to TESARO, Inc., under a Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement signed in <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2014</span>. The collaboration has resulted in three monospecific antibody therapies that have progressed into the clinic. These are: JEMPERLI (GSK4057190), a PD-1 antagonist; cobolimab, (GSK4069889), a TIM-3 antagonist; and GSK4074386, a LAG-3 antagonist. GSK is responsible for the ongoing research, development, commercialization, and manufacture of each of these Products under the Agreement.

<p align=""left"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism developing and delivering innovative treatments for genetically defined diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for mitapivat for the treatment of adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. The NDA was granted a Priority Review designation and has been given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of February 17, 2022, accelerating the review time from 10 months to six months from the day of filing acceptance. The FDA’s Priority Review designation is given to investigational medicines that treat a serious condition and offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness.</p>
“The acceptance of our NDA for mitapivat with priority review represents an important milestone on the path to expeditiously deliver the first potentially disease-modifying therapy for people with PK deficiency, a chronic, lifelong hemolytic anemia characterized by serious complications affecting multiple organs,” said Sarah Gheuens, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president of clinical development and incoming chief medical officer at Agios. “We look forward to working with the FDA during the review process and will continue to execute on our global strategy to ensure we are well positioned to rapidly deliver mitapivat to patients and healthcare providers upon approval.”

Agios also submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June 2021 for mitapivat as a potential treatment for adults with PK deficiency. As announced on the company’s second quarter 2021 earnings call, the MAA passed validation which triggered the start of the MAA review procedure.

The NDA and MAA submissions are based on results from two pivotal studies, ACTIVATE and ACTIVATE-T, conducted in not regularly transfused and regularly transfused adults with PK deficiency, respectively. A <a title=""full analysis of these data"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X24NVi2P4ewyxPCb6Rf57DqxwaUyHanKx-0wBXQMtzyJ8aYol8jRw3rLNCO2xnNCulpHRPa2U27R8-LF07bG7nf8eHWG5NROn2bEKMeg8QWuWcYsNG4sKqdyW7HWZ7QciXbOoOZN-Q6hCNXI9kHGc-GBjgV7BQ5oznf_5tH9AfvZEdJLziS_ED35xxX9UisBQSVVUtSQn-I8Z4QS1TgHz8Q2_OLdhe6H7FWw_jaJP1s="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">full analysis of these data</a> – including patient-reported outcomes (PRO) – was recently presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Virtual Congress. An extension study for adults with PK deficiency previously enrolled in ACTIVATE or ACTIVATE-T is ongoing and designed to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of treatment with mitapivat.

<em>Mitapivat is not currently approved for use in any country.</em>

<strong>About PK Deficiency</strong>
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare, inherited disease that presents as chronic hemolytic anemia, which is the accelerated destruction of red blood cells. The inherited mutations in PKR genes cause a deficit in energy within the red blood cell, as evidenced by lower PK enzyme activity, a decline in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and a build-up of upstream metabolites, including 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate).

PK deficiency is associated with serious complications, including gallstones, pulmonary hypertension, extramedullary hematopoiesis, osteoporosis and iron overload and its sequelae, which can occur regardless of the degree of anemia or transfusion burden. PK deficiency can also cause quality of life problems, including challenges with work and school activities, social life and emotional health. Current management strategies for PK deficiency, including red blood cell transfusions and splenectomy, are associated with both short- and long-term risks. There are no currently approved therapies for PK deficiency.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. &amp; RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verily, an Alphabet company, and SignalPath today announced that they have entered into an agreement in which Verily will acquire SignalPath, a privately held company based in Raleigh that has developed the SignalPath platform, a clinical trial management system (CTMS) that improves the ease, quality and efficiency of conducting clinical research at study sites.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Joining forces helps to accelerate and scale our shared vision, increase efficiency and lower costs in clinical trials, empower clinical research sites with world class technology, and ultimately bring medicines to patients faster,” said Amy Abernethy, MD, PhD, President of Clinical Studies Platforms at Verily. “It’s our goal to modernize the way clinical trials are conducted<b> </b>for patients, researchers and sponsors alike. Together, we will advance digital solutions<b> </b>to improve ease, quality, efficiency and speed in the current clinical trial paradigm.”

The acquisition will strengthen and expand Verily’s existing clinical trial system and evidence generation platform, known as Baseline. The Baseline platform enables better and faster clinical trial execution, improved data aggregation and analysis, flexible study options designed for decentralized and hybrid trials, and the ability to capture real-world data, such as that generated by novel sensors and biomarkers. In addition, the Baseline community now numbers more than 500,000 individuals who are interested in participating in clinical research and automatically matched with research opportunities that meet their interests and profiles.

SignalPath was founded in 2014 with a similar goal to change the way that clinical research is conducted, and a specific focus on building state-of-the-art software to improve efficiency for clinical research sites. SignalPath’s platform reduces fragmentation by leveraging a modern software architecture with a cloud-based platform in order to optimize management of a study site’s clinical trials portfolio. SignalPath’s robust technology infrastructure offers novel approaches to partners that can dramatically improve the costs, complexities and time associated with clinical trials. By joining with Verily, SignalPath will be able to provide clinical research sites access to a quickly growing portfolio of resources, tools and trial opportunities that further strengthen its value proposition.

“At SignalPath, we’ve created a better research ecosystem - one that combines a network of premier, technology-enabled research sites with a best-in-class suite of clinical trial tools to address the pain points experienced by patients, sites and sponsors,” said Brad Hirsch, MD, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of SignalPath. “Combining these capabilities with Verily’s clinical studies platforms business accelerates our ability to scale these solutions and make them available to a larger group of sites as well as provide entirely new opportunities to our network. It is another step forward in accelerating clinical research and helping get treatments to market faster.”

“We are focused on the future of site-based, hybrid and decentralized clinical studies<b> </b>to accelerate evidence generation including drug and device development in a variety of formats that will make clinical research more accessible,” Dr. Abernethy continued. “Through our combined efforts, we hope to help bring medicines to patients more quickly, involve a larger community of people in the process by making participation in clinical research easier, and set a new standard for clinical studies and evidence generation.”

Dr. Abernethy joined Verily in June to lead Verily’s planned expansion into a full-scale clinical evidence generation platform supporting a broad range of clinical trials and real-world evidence (RWE) studies. She was most recently Principal Deputy Commissioner of Food and Drugs of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the agency's acting Chief Information Officer. Dr. Abernethy is credited with having catalyzed enduring changes in the way the FDA uses data as well as advancing FDA's work in RWE and personalized medicine.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING &amp; HEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160) and EUSA Pharma (UK), Ltd. today announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted QARZIBA<sup>® </sup>(dinutuximab beta) conditional approval for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with a history of relapsed or refractory (R/R) neuroblastoma with or without residual disease. Dinutuximab beta is a targeted immunotherapy approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<sup>i</sup>

“Dinutuximab beta represents an important biologic therapy for pediatric patients in China, having been listed in the first batch of New Drugs in Urgent Clinical Need Marketed Overseas by the NMPA,” commented Xiaobin Wu, Ph.D., President, Chief Operating Officer, and General Manager of China at BeiGene. “For these young patients fighting neuroblastoma in China, we are proud to bring the first approved treatment.”

“We are delighted that the benefit of dinutuximab beta has been recognized in China. This approval represents an important milestone in our mission and collaboration with BeiGene of bringing innovative cancer and rare disease therapies to patients,” said Carsten Thiel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of EUSA Pharma.

The approval of dinutuximab beta in China for the treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma was supported by clinical results available from key trials conducted by SIOPEN (The International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma Group) in collaboration with APEIRON Biologics and EUSA Pharma. These randomized controlled trials evaluated the efficacy of dinutuximab beta by comparing the administration of dinutuximab beta with and without interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the first-line treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and in two single-arm studies in the R/R setting. In the SIOPEN trial (HR-NBL1), the five-year event-free survival (EFS) rate in patients treated with dinutuximab beta was 57% vs. 42% of historical controls (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01) and the five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 64% vs. 50% (<i>p</i>≤0.0001).<sup>ii</sup> The safety of dinutuximab beta has been evaluated in 514 patients. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia and pain that occurred despite analgesic treatment. Other frequent adverse reactions were hypersensitivity, vomiting, diarrhea, capillary leak syndrome, and hypotension.

<b>About QARZIBA<sup>®</sup> (dinutuximab beta)</b>

QARZIBA<sup>®</sup> is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the carbohydrate moiety of disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is overexpressed on neuroblastoma cells.

<strong>Basel, August 17, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced positive results from two Phase III clinical trials assessing Beovu<sup>®</sup> (brolucizumab) 6 mg versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). Year two of the pivotal KITE* trial evaluated Beovu on up to 16-week dosing intervals, and the one-year KINGFISHER study evaluated Beovu dosed every four weeks<sup>1,3</sup>. Both trials demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile.

Results from year two (week 100) of KITE demonstrated that a majority of patients who successfully completed an initial 12-week cycle following the loading phase were maintained on a 12- or 16-week dosing interval through the end of the study<sup>1</sup>. As previously reported, KITE met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to aflibercept in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at year one (week 52). At year one, Beovu showed greater reductions versus aflibercept in central subfield thickness (CSFT) and in number of eyes with intraretinal fluid and/or subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF), which were key fluid-related secondary endpoints. Year two results were consistent with those seen at year one, including maintenance of BCVA and greater reductions in CSFT and in number of eyes with IRF/SRF treated with Beovu versus aflibercept<sup>1</sup><sup>,2</sup>. CSFT is a key indicator of fluid in the retina, and fluid is a key marker of disease activity<sup>4,5</sup>. Year two findings from KESTREL, another pivotal Phase III trial of Beovu in DME, are due to read out in Q4 of this year.

“Patients with DME often struggle to adhere to burdensome treatment schedules as they manage various comorbidities related to diabetes,” said Prof. Dr. Justus Garweg, Clinic Director, Berne Eye Clinic at Lindenhof Hospital, Switzerland. “The extended dosing and fluid resolution observed in the KITE clinical trial suggest Beovu has the potential to manage the disease in appropriate patients with a relaxed loading phase every six weeks, and dosing intervals as infrequent as every twelve or sixteen weeks.”

Another Phase III trial, KINGFISHER, met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to aflibercept in change in BCVA from baseline at year one (week 52) when dosed every four weeks<sup>3</sup>. Beovu also demonstrated superiority versus aflibercept in key fluid-related secondary endpoints at year one, including reductions in CSFT and in number of eyes with IRF/SRF<sup>3</sup>.

In KITE, the most common (≥5%) overall adverse events were cataract and dry eye. Rates of intraocular inflammation (IOI) in KITE were 2.2% for Beovu and 1.7% for aflibercept, and no retinal vasculitis (RV) was reported in either arm. Rates of retinal vascular occlusion (RO) were 0.6% for Beovu versus 0.6% for aflibercept. In KITE, the majority of IOI events were manageable and resolved without any clinical complications. No RO events were associated with inflammation or vasculitis.

In KINGFISHER, the most common (≥5%) overall adverse events were COVID-19 and hypertension<sup>3</sup>. Rates of IOI were 4.0% for Beovu (including 0.9% RV) and 2.9% for aflibercept (including 0.6% RV)<sup>3</sup>. RO rates were 0.3% for Beovu versus 0.6% for aflibercept<sup>3</sup>. The majority of IOI events were manageable and resolved without any clinical complications<sup>3</sup>. No RO events were associated with inflammation or vasculitis.

“The year two KITE results reaffirm that Beovu may meet an important need to extend dosing intervals for patients with diabetic macular edema, who are often overburdened with medical appointments,” said Jill Hopkins, Global Development Unit Head, Ophthalmology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Along with the top-line results from KINGFISHER, the KITE findings add to the growing body of data supporting our understanding of where Beovu may potentially fit into the DME treatment landscape. We look forward to continuing discussions with global health authorities about the findings from the KESTREL and KITE clinical trials, and we will continue to assess the clinical relevance of the positive KINGFISHER findings.”

Further details of KITE and KINGFISHER will be presented at upcoming medical meetings.

<strong>About the KESTREL, KITE and KINGFISHER clinical trials</strong>
KESTREL, KITE and KINGFISHER are global, randomized, double-masked, Phase III, two-year studies comparing the safety and efficacy of Beovu and aflibercept in the treatment of DME<sup>6-8</sup>.

KESTREL and KITE involved 926 patients in 36 countries<sup>6,7</sup>. In the loading phase of both trials, patients in the Beovu arms were treated every six weeks for a total of five doses; patients in the aflibercept arms were treated every four weeks for a total of five doses, in line with its label<sup>6,7</sup>. Following the loading phase, patients in the Beovu arms were subsequently treated every 12 weeks, with those demonstrating disease activity moved to dosing every eight weeks for the remainder of the study<sup>6,7</sup>.

At week 72 of KITE, Beovu patients dosed every 12 weeks could be extended to dosing every 16 weeks, and patients dosed every eight weeks could be extended to every 12 weeks<sup>7</sup>. As in year one, those demonstrating disease activity were moved to dosing every eight weeks for the remainder of the study<sup>7</sup>. Through the entirety of both two-year trials, patients in the aflibercept arms were treated every eight weeks<sup>6,7</sup>.

KINGFISHER evaluated 517 patients at 115 centers over the course of one year<sup>8</sup>. Patients were treated with Beovu or aflibercept every four weeks through week 48, with a four-week follow-up period, for a total of 13 visits<sup>8</sup>.

<strong>About diabetic macular edema (DME)</strong>
DME is a common microvascular complication in patients with diabetes that may have a debilitating impact on visual acuity, eventually leading to blindness<sup>9</sup>. DME is the leading cause of blindness in adults in developed countries, affecting 12% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes<sup>9</sup>.

Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid<sup>10</sup>. This damage leads to an excess of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<sup>9,10</sup>. VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels<sup>9,10</sup>. At elevated levels in DME, VEGF stimulates the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels<sup>9,10</sup>. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss<sup>9,10</sup>. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision<sup>10</sup>. Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages<sup>10,11</sup>.

<strong>About Beovu (brolucizumab) 6 mg</strong>
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) 6 mg is approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 70 countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada and Australia<sup>12-16</sup>. Additional trials, which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with wet AMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), are currently ongoing.

63574,PharmaShots Interview: Revolo’s Jonathan Rigby Shares Insights on the ‘1104 for Eosinophilic Esophagitis,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with<strong> PharmaShots, Jonathan</strong><strong> Rigby, Group Chief Executive Officer at Revolo Biotherapeutics </strong>shared his views on the unique mechanism of â€˜<strong>1104</strong> and discuss the plan of the companyâ€™s clinical studies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What is Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> EoE is a progressive rare allergic disease characterized by difficulty swallowing and gastric reflux, as a result of elevated numbers of inflammatory immune cells in the esophagus wall. &nbsp;Roughly&nbsp;180,000 children and adults&nbsp;in the US have EoE,&nbsp;and up to 80% of patients have secondary allergic conditions. Early disease control is critical to avoid the thickening of the tissue of the esophagus.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>There are no FDA-approved drug products for EoE, and&nbsp;50,000 patients are unresponsive to available treatments, including long-term steroids. Patients may take proton pump inhibitors, but chronic frequent dosing often leads to poor compliance.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the MoA of 1104. How will this drug change the treatment landscape for EoE.?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> </em>â€˜<em>1104 is a peptide that was derived from a natural immune-regulatory protein,&nbsp;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&nbsp;Chaperonin 60.1, that plays a key role in immune system function.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In allergic diseases, such as EoE, the immune system â€œoverreactsâ€ to certain molecules (allergic antigens) that are unknown to the body. This results in the stimulation of inflammatory immune cells and molecules, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Most pharmaceutical solutions currently in use or in development focus on alleviating the overactive immune and inflammatory response after it starts, by targeting downstream processes and leaving many patients with unresolved symptoms.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>&nbsp;â€˜1104 resets the immune response â€œupstream,â€ or ahead of the inflammatory cascade, stimulating the production of immune cells that regulate the inflammatory response, thereby preventing the immune system from entering overdrive.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>â€˜1104 has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for EoE by providing long-term disease remission</em> while eliminating the risk of life-threatening immune suppression often seen with the <em>current standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the P-I results of 1104 that allow you to advance the program to the P-II study.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> â€˜1104 has already been evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials. In the first Phase 1 placebo-controlled clinical trial, administration of â€˜1104 intravenously and subcutaneously was safe at clinically relevant doses in 94 healthy volunteers and patients with mild asthma. A second Phase 1 multiple ascending dose studies in 18 healthy subjects found again that â€˜1104 given intravenously was safe and tolerable also with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and served as the basis of the selection of the 8 mg dose for a subsequent Phase 2 EoE trial.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What motivates you to work on eosinophilic esophagitis?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Until a few years ago, there was little awareness about eosinophilic disorders like EoE. There are no FDA-approved drug products for this debilitating disease and a significant number of patients are left to adapt their diet and take medications without a total response.&nbsp; Given the allergic nature of the disease</em> and the mechanism of action of â€˜1104, we believe it has the potential to really change the treatment landscape for these patients and are excited to provide them with the first-ever<em> disease-modifying therapy. We look forward to advancing a Phase 2 trial before the end of the year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Big leaders like GSK, Sanofi or Takeda are also working on EoE. Do you think Revoloâ€™s 1104 can compete with its competitors?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Absolutely. There are others working to develop a therapy for EoE, but what makes our therapy and approach different from all others is that our drug acts before the inflammatory response occur. We donâ€™t focus on targeting individual inflammatory molecules such as cytokines that are produced after the inflammatory response has begun. â€˜1104 may prevent the inflammatory response from ever starting, which could drive clinical improvement compared to the current standard of care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How is the company revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We are revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment by&nbsp;advancing therapies that may achieve superior long-term disease remission, require less frequent dosing, and avoid suppression of the immune system.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the companyâ€™s clinical trial plans for this year and the coming years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We recently received approval of an investigational new drug application by the FDA to evaluate â€˜1104 in a Phase 2 trial for EoE. We also received Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK to evaluate â€˜1104 in a Phase 2 allergen sensitivity study. We expect to start enrolling in both studies shortly and anticipate providing updates before the end of next year.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We are also advancing â€˜1805, a modified analog of the endogenous binding immunoglobulin protein otherwise known as BiP, which is another key player in immune function. We anticipate initiating two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating â€˜1805, one&nbsp;for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and the other for non-infectious uveitis in the near term.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Given the agnostic nature of the mechanism of action of â€˜1104 and â€˜1805, we believe they have the potential to treat multiple allergic and autoimmune diseases, respectively and we continue to explore additional indications.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations to develop and commercialize your pipeline products?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We welcome collaborations with strategic partners who are looking to join us in drastically shifting the treatment landscape for allergic and autoimmune diseases. As we advance our clinical pipeline, we will consider every opportunity in order to bring treatments to patients in need as quickly as possible. We have identified many more additional indications for â€˜1805 and â€˜1104, and we are always willing to discuss partnerships as we explore the endless potential of these platform programs.</em></p>

<strong>OXFORD, U.K. – August 18, 2021</strong> – Exscientia, a clinical-stage, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven pharmatech company, today announced that Bristol Myers Squibb has elected to in-license an immune-modulating drug candidate created by Exscientia. Exscientia has two active collaborations with Bristol Myers Squibb, which together focus on multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology. A significant expansion of the relationship was announced earlier this year.

The in-licensed candidate targets a critical immunological kinase that historically has proven difficult to target due to the need for a combination of potency, selectivity, and overall drug-like properties. To design a novel candidate that overcame these issues, Exscientia utilized its end-to-end platform to drive the discovery process, including AI-driven design, structural biology, chemistry, and pharmacology, as well as late-stage preclinical studies. Exscientia’s precision design approach focused on solving, in parallel, parameters important to overall therapeutic performance for the target, such as potency, selectivity, safety, and physicochemical characteristics. Exscientia’s platform is ideally suited for solving multi-objective design problems to efficiently and rapidly discover novel drug candidates with superior properties.

Andrew Hopkins, Chief Executive Officer of Exscientia commented, “We are focused on using our patient-first AI technology to design precision engineered drugs against challenging drug product profiles. We are seeing great efficiency from our platform. This drug candidate molecule was just the 150th novel compound to be designed and tested and it was identified within 11 months of starting drug design. In partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb and its world-class research, clinical and commercialization capabilities, we look forward to advancing this candidate into the next stage of development.”

Rupert Vessey, President of Research &amp; Early Development at Bristol Myers Squibb said, “We are pleased to in-license our first drug candidate resulting from our strategic collaboration with Exscientia. Artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to play important roles in drug discovery and Exscientia has delivered a promising development candidate in the field of immunology. We look forward to our continued collaboration and further advancing this candidate for the potential benefit of patients with unmet medical need.”

Bristol Myers Squibb will be responsible for clinical and commercial development of the drug candidate. Under the terms of the agreement, Exscientia will receive a $20 million option exercise fee with the potential for additional development milestones as well as tiered royalties on any product sales.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 18, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the <i>New England Journal of Medicine </i>(<i>NEJM</i>) has published 12-week results from the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial evaluating atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults who meet criteria for episodic migraine. The study, which enrolled adult participants experiencing 4 to 14 migraine days per month, found that all active treatment arms of atogepant – 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg once-daily doses – met their primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period compared to placebo.<sup>2</sup> The study also found that a greater proportion of atogepant-treated participants achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days for all doses compared to placebo and met other key secondary endpoints.<sup class=""last-child"">2</sup>

The full NEJM article is available at <a class=""first-child last-child"" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3258634-1&amp;h=3726394381&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2035908&amp;a=nejm.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">nejm.org</a>.

Atogepant, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is an investigational orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant), which, if approved, will be the first and only oral gepant specifically developed for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">3</sup>

""Too many people around the world face the incapacitating challenges of migraine, which place undue burden on patients, care partners, and health systems,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Michael Gold</span>, M.D., vice president, neuroscience development, AbbVie. ""At AbbVie, we are resolutely committed to advancing new treatment options across the migraine continuum. These data reinforce our confidence in atogepant as a potential option for the preventive treatment of migraine.""

The primary endpoint for the ADVANCE trial was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> All atogepant dose groups met the primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo.<sup>1</sup> Patients treated in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg atogepant arms experienced a decrease of 3.7, 3.9, and 4.2 days respectively compared to patients in the placebo arm, who experienced a decrease of 2.5 days (all dose groups versus placebo, p&lt;0.0001).<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

Efficacy results for prespecified, multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints in the ADVANCE trial across the 12-week treatment period include<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup>:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">Patients treated with 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg doses of atogepant experienced a decrease in mean monthly headache days of 3.9 (baseline 8.4), 4.0 (baseline 8.8), and 4.2 (baseline 9.0) days respectively versus a 2.5-day (baseline 8.4) decline in the placebo arm (p&lt;0.0001 for all doses).</li>
 	<li>A significantly greater reduction from baseline in acute medication use days was seen with all doses of atogepant compared to placebo, with a decrease of 3.7, 3.7, and 3.9 days for the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg doses respectively compared to a 2.4-day decrease with placebo (p&lt;0.0001 for all doses).</li>
 	<li>Across the 12-week treatment period, the trial demonstrated that 55.6%, 58.7%, and 60.8% of patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg atogepant arms respectively achieved a 50% or greater reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to 29.0% of patients in the placebo arm (all dose groups versus placebo, p&lt;0.0001).</li>
 	<li>Improvements in the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1) Role Function-Restrictive domain score were significantly greater with atogepant at all doses (9.9, 10.1, and 10.8 point improvements, p&lt;0.0001 for all doses) compared to placebo at week 12.*</li>

All doses were well tolerated. The most common adverse events reported with a frequency ≥ 5% in at least one atogepant treatment arm, and greater than placebo, were constipation (6.9-7.7% across all doses versus 0.5% for placebo), nausea (4.4-6.1% across all doses versus 1.8% for placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (3.9-5.7% across all doses versus 4.5% for placebo).

<b class=""first-child"">About Migraine<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Migraine is a complex, chronic disease with recurrent attacks that are often incapacitating and characterized by headache pain as well as neurologic and autonomic symptoms.<sup>4 </sup>It is highly prevalent, affecting more than 1 billion people worldwide, including 39 million people in the U.S. alone,<sup>5 </sup>and is the highest cause of disability worldwide for people under 50 years of age.<sup class=""last-child"">6,7 </sup>Due to the unpredictability and fluctuation of attack frequency and severity, migraine substantially impacts many aspects of an individual's life both during and between attacks. Daily activities, work, school, and personal relationships can be negatively affected, leading to a significant burden on the person with migraine, their family, friends, employers, and healthcare systems.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Atogepant<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Atogepant is an investigational orally administered, CGRP receptor antagonist (gepant) specifically developed for the preventive treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. Studies have shown that CGRP levels are elevated during migraine attacks and selective CGRP receptor antagonists confer clinical benefit in migraine. Atogepant is currently under review by the U.S. FDA.

RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 18, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Jardiance<sup>®</sup> (empagliflozin) 10 mg has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death plus hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today.

Jardiance is not for people with type 1 diabetes as it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients. It is not for use to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes with an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> as it is likely to be ineffective in this setting based upon its mechanism of action.

Jardiance can be initiated in adults with HFrEF with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.

""Heart failure is a chronic, debilitating cardio-renal-metabolic condition affecting over 60 million people worldwide. As the prevalence of heart failure continues to rise, the need for new treatment options is critical,"" said Javed Butler, M.D., Chairman, Department of Medicine, University of Mississippi. ""Empagliflozin is a vital new therapeutic option to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.""

HFrEF, which accounts for more than half of heart failure cases, occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively, and less blood is pumped out to the body compared with a normally functioning heart.

This approval for Jardiance is based on results from the EMPEROR-Reduced phase III trial, which investigated the effect of adding Jardiance 10 mg versus placebo to standard of care in a broad range of 3,730 adults with and without type 2 diabetes who had heart failure (functional class II, III or IV) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. In the trial, Jardiance significantly reduced the relative risk of the primary composite endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 25% (5.3% absolute risk reduction, 0.75 HR, 0.65-0.86 95% CI) versus placebo. These results were seen regardless of background heart failure standard of care treatments.

A key secondary endpoint analysis from EMPEROR-Reduced demonstrated that Jardiance helped keep patients out of the hospital by significantly reducing the relative risk of first and recurrent hospitalization for heart failure by 30% (388 events for Jardiance vs. 553 for placebo, 0.70 HR, 0.58-0.85 95% CI). The safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile of Jardiance.

Jardiance is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or any of the excipients of Jardiance as reactions such as angioedema have occurred and is contraindicated in patients on dialysis. <b>Please see additional Important Safety Information below.</b>

""Around half of all people with heart failure, unfortunately, are expected to die within five years of diagnosis. The risk of death increases with each hospitalization for heart failure,"" said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A., vice president, Clinical Development &amp; Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism &amp; Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""In the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, Jardiance protected a broad range of adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction by reducing risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, regardless of their baseline heart failure medications or type 2 diabetes status, when added to standard of care. Today's FDA approval of Jardiance in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, which follows authorization for use in the EU by the European Commission in June, marks an important milestone in our journey to help transform care for adults with heart failure. We look forward to continuing to investigate the potential benefit of Jardiance across cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.""

""Today's approval is significant for the millions of people diagnosed with this form of heart failure, offering additional hope for those who have seen limited new treatment options over the last decade,"" said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. ""Following EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>®</sup>, this is the second U.S. regulatory decision stemming from the EMPOWER clinical trial program, which is exploring the impact of Jardiance on major clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Jardiance is already a recognized leader for adults with type 2 diabetes, including those who also have established cardiovascular disease. We're excited to build on that legacy with this new indication that establishes Jardiance as an effective treatment for adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction – regardless of whether they have type 2 diabetes.""

<b>About EMPEROR-Reduced </b>
EMPEROR–Reduced (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3263610-1&amp;h=3693457611&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03057977%3Fterm%3Demperor&amp;a=NCT03057977"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03057977</a>) was a phase III international, randomized, double–blind trial that enrolled 3,730 adults with and without type 2 diabetes. All participants had heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II, III or IV) for at least 3 months and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less at their most recent assessment. At randomization, 75% of patients were NYHA class II, 24% were class III and 0.5% were class IV.

Participants were randomized to once-daily Jardiance 10 mg (n=1,863) or placebo (n=1,867), on top of treatment with guideline-directed heart failure therapy. Median follow-up time was 16 months. The composite primary endpoint was defined as time to first event of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

<b>Prioritizing Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Care</b>
Through research and educational initiatives, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are driven to redefine care for people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, a group of interconnected disorders that affect more than one billion people worldwide and are a leading cause of death.

The cardiovascular, renal (kidney) and metabolic systems are closely intertwined and share many of the same disease-related pathways. Dysfunction in one system may accelerate the onset of dysfunction in others, resulting in the progression of comorbid diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Conversely, improving the health of one system can lead to positive effects across the others and can help reduce the risk for further complications.

Understanding their interconnected nature, we are working to advance treatments for people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. It is only through a holistic approach to care that we can truly transform outcomes and restore the harmony between these critical systems.

<b>Wh</b><b>a</b><b>t is JARDIANCE? </b>(<u><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3263610-1&amp;h=3231058130&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jardiance.com%2F&amp;a=www.jardiance.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.jardiance.com</a></u>)

JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used to:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>lower blood sugar along with diet and exercise in adults with type 2 diabetes</li>
 	<li>reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who also have known cardiovascular disease</li>
 	<li>reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the rest of your body) in adults with heart failure</li>
</ul>
JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes. It may increase their risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).

JARDIANCE is not for use to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who have severe kidney problems, because it may not work.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>Do not take </b>JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.

<b>Do not take </b>JARDIANCE if you are on dialysis.

<b>J</b><b>A</b><b>RDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine).</b> Ketoacidosis is a serious condition which needs to be treated in the hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes taking JARDIANCE,<b> even if blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL</b>. Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with JARDIANCE. <b>Stop taking JARDIANCE and call your healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room if you get any of the following symptoms, </b>and if possible, check for ketones in your urine:
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>nausea</li>
 	<li>vomiting</li>
 	<li>stomach-area (abdominal) pain</li>
 	<li>tiredness</li>
 	<li>trouble breathing</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Dehydration. JARDIANCE </b>can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up. Sudden worsening of kidney function has happened in people who are taking JARDIANCE.</li>
</ul>
You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)</li>
 	<li>are on a low salt diet</li>
 	<li>have kidney problems</li>
 	<li>are 65 years of age or older</li>
</ul>
Talk to your healthcare provider about what you can do to prevent dehydration, including how much fluid you should drink on a daily basis, and if you reduce the amount of food or liquid you drink, if you are sick or cannot eat, or start to lose liquids from your body from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Serious urinary tract infections.</b> Serious urinary tract infections can occur in people taking JARDIANCE and may lead to hospitalization. Tell your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as a burning feeling when passing urine, a need to urinate often or right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach or pelvis, or blood in the urine. Sometimes people also may have a fever, back pain, nausea or vomiting.</li>
 	<li><b>L</b><b>o</b><b>w blood sugar </b>(hypoglycemia): If you take JARDIANCE with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea or insulin may need to be lowered. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include:
<ul type=""circle"">

SHANGHAI, China and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. (“Junshi Biosciences”, HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180) and Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (“Coherus”, Nasdaq: CHRS), today announced positive interim results from the pivotal study “CHOICE-01” (NCT03856411), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating toripalimab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of advanced squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The interim analysis met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 compared to chemotherapy alone.

The results will be summarized September 13 in an oral presentation by Professor Jie Wang, MD, PhD, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College, during the Mini Oral Session at the 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H_AFgvy3BWm6MOFE8xAfPPCLIjk4RgV1ApYEHWDLWmXBlO_ljmgIlbnBqfOaac8TxCIaTv7UM6Eul8Zss-YXRdl4HnNjK0FbibVPVMaqSuMQTP5VcXj7YbhUuw29U8cooOyXVc9vu5hMvTG4vgrSdxHh9p-J1GKfjc5milo1lqGLWli2ypwUTU7dmPq4AoqhMTwS3HR0kHpNH8oJdWSJHcBPM-CtZRacffuidAVc6loA4TRiTFg7HSi8GWbDDeTOpc0F5GdTrT1pXwXqo4aUYQ=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">abstract</a> is now available on the WCLC website.

“The CHOICE-01 study in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer has demonstrated the clinical benefit of toripalimab in yet another first-line setting, building on the evidence of efficacy in first-line studies in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,” said Dr. Patricia Keegan, Chief Medical Officer at Junshi Biosciences. “With an excellent clinical profile being established across multiple tumor types, we expect to pursue registration for toripalimab for a broad array of indications in China, the United States and other markets.”

“The CHOICE-01 efficacy and safety data are compelling and demonstrate the potential for toripalimab to deliver the significant benefits of the PD-1 class of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to patients with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Ildiko Csiki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Coherus Scientific Advisory Board and Chief Commercial Research and Development Officer at City of Hope, a comprehensive cancer center. “As data accumulate in the pivotal studies in the broad clinical development program, toripalimab is showing itself to be an excellent checkpoint inhibitor. We eagerly anticipate results from additional Phase 3 studies in esophageal, lung, liver, breast, kidney, bladder, stomach, and skin cancers.”

<strong>About CHOICE-01</strong>
A total of 465 treatment-naive advanced NSCLC patients (220 squamous and 245 non-squamous) were randomized (2:1): 309 to the toripalimab plus chemotherapy arm and 156 to the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. The primary endpoint of PFS was assessed by the investigator. Secondary endpoints included PFS assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). Crossover to toripalimab was allowed for patients from the placebo plus chemotherapy arm upon disease progression.
<ul>
 	<li>As of November 17, 2020 (the data cut-off date of the interim analysis), 218 PFS events were observed, with a median follow-up of 7.1 and 7.0 months in the toripalimab arm and the placebo arm, respectively.</li>
 	<li>At the interim analysis, a significant improvement in PFS was detected for toripalimab over placebo [hazard ratio (HR)=0.58,95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.77, P=0.0001] with median PFS of 8.3 vs. 5.6 months. The 1-year PFS rates for toripalimab and placebo arms were 32.6% and 13.1%, respectively.</li>
 	<li>This improvement in PFS was observed in both squamous [HR = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.38-0.83)] and non-squamous [HR=0.59 (95% CI: 0.40-0.87)] NSCLC and regardless of PD-L1 expression.</li>
 	<li>PFS assessed by BIRC showed similar results as PFS assessed by the investigator.</li>
 	<li>Toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy, as compared with chemotherapy alone, resulted in better ORR (squamous NSCLC: 68.7% vs. 58.9%; non-squamous NSCLC: 58.6% versus 26.5%) and median DoR (squamous NSCLC: 6.9 months vs. 4.2 months; non-squamous NSCLC: 8.6 months vs. 5.1 months).</li>
 	<li>Patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy arm were actively crossed over to toripalimab treatment at the time of disease progression.</li>
 	<li>Overall survival data were not yet mature as of March 7, 2021. There was a trend favoring the toripalimab arm [median OS of 21.0 vs. 16.0 months, HR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57-1.17)].</li>
 	<li>The addition of toripalimab to standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC showed a manageable safety profile with no new safety signal observed. The incidence of Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was 76.3% in the toripalimab arm vs. 80.1% in the control arm. AEs leading to discontinuation of toripalimab or placebo were 12.3% vs. 1.9%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
Junshi Biosciences and Coherus plan to meet with the United States Food and Drug Administration to discuss a potential submission of a biologics license application for toripalimab for first line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

<strong>About toripalimab</strong>

Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and for enhanced receptor internalization (endocytosis function). Blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 is thought to recharge the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells.

More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally, including in China and the United States. Pivotal clinical trials are ongoing or completed evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab for a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin.

In China, toripalimab was the first domestic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for marketing (approved in China as TUOYI<sup>®</sup>). On December 17, 2018, toripalimab was granted a conditional approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the second-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In December 2020, toripalimab was successfully included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List. In February 2021, the supplemental NDA for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was accepted by the NMPA. In the same month, the NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after failure of at least two lines of prior systemic therapy. In April, NMPA granted a conditional approval to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who failed platinum-containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.

In the United States, a rolling submission of the first toripalimab Biologics License Application (BLA) is underway for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1<sup>st</sup> line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”) and also for toripalimab monotherapy in second or third line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. There are currently no PD-1 blocking antibodies indicated for use in NPC in the United States. Additionally, FDA has granted Fast Track status for the development of toripalimab for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designation for NPC, mucosal melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Earlier in 2021 Coherus in-licensed rights to develop and commercialize toripalimab in the United States and Canada. Coherus and Junshi Biosciences plan to file additional toripalimab BLAs with the FDA over the next three years for multiple rare cancers and highly prevalent cancers.

<p align=""justify"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOWL), an innovative biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of conditionally activated therapeutics engineered to stimulate the body’s immune system for the treatment of cancer, today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to evaluate WTX-124, a systemically-delivered, conditionally activated Interleukin-2 (IL-2) INDUKINE product candidate, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy. The planned clinical trial will be conducted by Werewolf Therapeutics and is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of WTX-124 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with solid tumors.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Werewolf Therapeutics is delighted to be partnering with Merck to study the combination of KEYTRUDA and WTX-124, a molecule designed to deliver IL-2 preferentially to the tumor microenvironment and the first of Werewolf’s INDUKINE portfolio to enter the clinic,” said Randi Isaacs, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Werewolf Therapeutics. “The clinical benefit of targeting IL-2 as a treatment for cancer has long been established; however, its utility has been limited by challenging toxicities. We believe WTX-124 has the potential to enhance therapeutic options for cancer patients as a monotherapy and when combined with checkpoint inhibitors like KEYTRUDA.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">WTX-124 is a systemically-delivered, conditionally activated IL-2 INDUKINE molecule that has been engineered to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with recombinant IL-2 therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in multiple tumor types. Werewolf Therapeutics plans to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application for WTX-124 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2022. Subject to FDA clearance of the IND application, Werewolf Therapeutics expects to promptly initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating WTX-124 as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of solid tumors.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc.</strong></p>

<p align=""justify"">SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the discovery and development of novel antibody-based immunotherapies, today announced that it has entered into a third clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (known as “MSD” outside the United States and Canada). The agreement includes an open-label, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of ADG106 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 KEYTRUDA<sup><strong>®</strong></sup> (pembrolizumab) in advanced or metastatic solid and/or hematological malignancies (ADG106-P2001/KEYNOTE-D12). This clinical study builds on the promising monotherapy and combination therapy data from a Phase I trial of ADG106. Engineered using Adagene’s proprietary NEObody™ platform technology, ADG106 is a fully human, ligand-blocking, agonistic anti-CD137 immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are excited to continue our partnership with Merck in a third clinical collaboration that now combines our anti-CD137 agonist, ADG106, with KEYTRUDA,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Adagene. “While PD-1 drugs have advanced the cancer treatment paradigm, there are still a substantial number of patients with advanced metastatic solid and hematological malignancies who either relapse or are unresponsive, highlighting the need for new approaches. ADG106 targets a unique and highly conserved epitope with a novel mechanism of action and broad species cross reactivity, which enables testing in immunocompetent hosts. In multiple syngeneic models, we have shown a strong additive effect between ADG106 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We look forward to working closely with Merck and combining ADG106 with KEYTRUDA,” said Steven Fischkoff, M.D., interim Chief Medical Officer of Adagene. “Together with our novel mechanism of action, extensive preclinical and strong clinical data generated to date, we believe ADG106 is an ideal candidate to combine with an anti-PD1 antibody to potentially create a new therapeutic option for cancer patients with unmet medical needs.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About </strong><strong>ADG106</strong>
ADG106, is a fully human ligand-blocking, agonistic anti-CD137 IgG4 mAb being developed for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. CD137 stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells and is a key driver for long-lasting T cell proliferation and survival. In preclinical studies, we observed that ADG106 had robust antitumor activity and was well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with the existing standard-of-care and other immuno-oncology therapies. ADG106 activates CD137 in a native ligand-like fashion, blocks reverse CD137 ligand signaling, and induces potent cross-linking by Fc receptors. Because of this novel mechanism of action, ADG106 was observed to favorably balance CD137 agonism over CD137-induced liver toxicity, which we believe has potential to address the limitations of other existing anti-CD137 therapies.</p>
<p align=""justify"">ADG106 Phase I trials have been successfully completed with enrollment of nearly 100 patients with advanced solid tumors and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the United States and China. Based on the promising Phase I data, ADG106 is being evaluated in a Phase Ib/II combination study in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted Conditional Marketing Authorization for <i>Abecma </i>(idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel), a first-in-class B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

<i>Abecma </i>is the first and only CAR T cell therapy approved that is directed to recognize and bind to BCMA, a protein that is nearly universally expressed on cancer cells in multiple myeloma, leading to the death of BCMA-expressing cells.<sup>1</sup><i>Abecma</i> is delivered via a single infusion with a target dose of 420 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-positive viable T cells within a range of 260 to 500 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-positive viable T cells. <i>Abecma </i>is approved for use in all European Union (EU) member states.*

“The EC approval of <i>Abecma </i>is an important milestone for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and moves us closer to offering a first-in-class, personalized therapy to patients in Europe battling this incurable disease after exhausting prior treatment options with the three standards of care,” said Samit Hirawat, M.D., chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “With this third regulatory approval for <i>Abecma </i>worldwide<i>, </i>we are proud to be advancing the science of cell therapy and continuing to bring this first anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy to patients in need.”

In Europe, nearly 50,000 people are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year.<sup>2</sup> Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease, and many patients suffer through periods of remission and relapse. Patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have been exposed to all three major drug classes often have poor clinical outcomes and few remaining treatment options.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup>

“In multiple myeloma, when a patient’s cancer is no longer responding to their current treatment regimen or the patient relapses, the disease becomes increasingly difficult to treat,” said Jesus San Miguel, M.D., Ph.D., Medical Director of the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Navarra, Spain and KarMMa clinical trial investigator. “In the KarMMa trial, treatment with ide-cel proved to elicit deep and durable responses in a significant proportion of patients with triple-class exposed multiple myeloma, including many who were heavily pretreated and had high-risk disease. The approval is important for patients in Europe, as it represents another potential therapeutic option for clinically meaningful outcomes and long-term disease control.”

Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to making <i>Abecma</i> commercially available to patients in the EU. The company is currently focused on several required factors, including treatment center qualification and onboarding, completion of reimbursement procedures and scaling up its manufacturing capacity to meet increasing global demand. The company is also actively pursuing options to expand its manufacturing global supply network to make <i>Abecma</i> available to more patients around the world, including the addition of a European-based manufacturing facility in Leiden, Netherlands. Meanwhile, Bristol Myers Squibb will continue to manufacture <i>Abecma </i>for EU and U.S. patients<i></i>at the company’s state-of-the-art cellular immunotherapy manufacturing facility in Summit, New Jersey.

“Multiple myeloma patients who have tried and exhausted multiple rounds of treatment options have been hoping for new and transformative options,” said Brian G.M. Durie, Chairman, International Myeloma Foundation. “The approval of <i>Abecma, </i>an innovative anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy, is an exciting milestone for patients in the European Union.”

<i>Abecma </i>was granted Conditional Marketing Authorization under the European Medicines Agency PRIME (Priority Medicines) scheme. Conditional Marketing Authorization is granted in the interest of public health where the benefit of immediate availability fulfills a critical unmet need. Conditional Marketing Authorization in the EU is initially valid for one year but can be extended or converted into a full Marketing Authorization after the submission and assessment of additional confirmatory data. For full details on the Special Warnings and Precautions for Use and Adverse Reactions (including appropriate management), please refer to the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

Bristol Myers Squibb offers various programs and resources to address the needs of patients and caregivers and help support access to therapies, including <i>Abecma.</i>

*<i>Centralized Marketing Authorization does not include approval in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).</i>

<b><i><span class=""bwuline"">Abecma </span></i><span class=""bwuline"">Clinical Trial Results</span></b>

The efficacy of <i>Abecma </i>is based on results from the pivotal KarMMa study in which 128 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and were refractory to the last treatment regimen were treated with<i> Abecma</i>.<sup>7</sup>

In the study, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73% (95% CI: 66-81), and 33% of patients achieved a complete response (CR; 95% CI: 25-41). Onset of response was rapid with a median time to response of one month. In addition, responses were durable, with a median duration of response of 10.6 months (95% CI: 8.0 – 11.4), and 23 months (95% CI: 11.4 – 23.3) for those who achieved a CR.<sup>7</sup>

In a pooled safety analysis of 184 patients treated with <i>Abecma </i>in the KarMMa and CRB-401 studies, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 81% of patients, with Grade <span class=""bwuline"">&gt;</span>3 CRS, using the Lee grading system, occurring in 5.4% of patients. There was one case of fatal (Grade 5) CRS reported. The median time to onset of CRS was one day (range: 1-17 days) and the median duration of CRS was five days (range: 1-63 days). Any grade neurotoxicity (NT) of the 128 patients receiving <i>Abecma </i>in the KarMMa study occurred in 18% of patients, including Grade 3 events in 3.1% of patients, with no Grade 4 or 5 events occurring. The median time to onset of NT was two days (range: 1-10 days) and the median duration was three days (range: 1-26 days).<sup>7</sup>

The most common (&gt;20%) adverse reactions in the pooled safety analysis included neutropenia, CRS, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, infections - pathogen unspecified, leucopenia, fatigue, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia, nausea, lymphopenia, pyrexia, cough, hypocalcaemia, infections - viral, headache, hypomagnesaemia, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and oedema peripheral. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia (88.6%), anaemia (58.2%), thrombocytopenia (53.5%), leucopenia (45.1%), lymphopenia (30.4%), infections - pathogen unspecified (17.9%), hypophosphataemia (17.4%), febrile neutropenia (14.7%), hypocalcaemia (7.1%), infections - viral (7.1%), pneumonia (6.0%), CRS (5.4%), hypertension (5.4%) and hyponatraemia (5.4%).<sup>7</sup>

 	<li>ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): </b>CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. CRS occurred in 85% (108/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. Grade 3 or higher CRS (Lee grading system) occurred in 9% (12/127) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in one (0.8%) patient. The median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 - 23 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 1 - 63 days) in all patients including the patient who died. The most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (98%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (35%), chills (31%), hypoxia (20%), fatigue (12%), and headache (10%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HLH/MAS.

Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS.

Fifty four percent (68/127) of patients received tocilizumab; 35% (45/127) received a single dose while 18% (23/127) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, across the dose levels, 15% (19/127) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS received tocilizumab.

Overall rate of CRS was 79% and rate of Grade 2 CRS was 23% in patients treated in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. For patients treated in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, the overall rate of CRS was 96% and rate of Grade 2 CRS was 40%. Rate of Grade 3 or higher CRS was similar across the dose range. The median duration of CRS for the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort was 7 days (range: 1-63 days) and for the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort was 6 days (range: 2-28 days). In the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, 68% (36/53) of patients received tocilizumab and 23% (12/53) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. In the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, 44% (31/70) of patients received tocilizumab and 10% (7/70) received corticosteroids. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS also received tocilizumab. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA.

Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated.

Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.

<b>Neurologic Toxicities: </b>Neurologic toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity occurred in 28% (36/127) of patients receiving ABECMA, including Grade 3 in 4% (5/127) of patients. One patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 - 42 days). CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 92% (33/36) of patients with a median duration of neurotoxicity was 5 days (range: 1 - 61 days). The median duration of neurotoxicity was 6 days (range: 1 - 578) in all patients including those with ongoing neurotoxicity at the time of death or data cut off. Thirty-four patients with neurotoxicity had CRS. Neurotoxicity had onset in 3 patients before, 29 patients during, and 2 patients after CRS. The rate of Grade 3 neurotoxicity was 8% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 1.4% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. The most frequently reported (greater than or equal to 5%) manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy (20%), tremor (9%), aphasia (7%), and delirium (6%). Grade 4 neurotoxicity and cerebral edema in 1 patient has been reported with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma. Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 3 parkinsonism have been reported after treatment with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma.

Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.

Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur at any time.

<b>Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): </b>HLH/MAS occurred in 4% (5/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. One patient treated in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS. In another patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, HLH/MAS was contributory to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. The rate of HLH/MAS was 8% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 1% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA with a median onset of 7 days (range: 4-9 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Two patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and cytopenia. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards.

<b>ABECMA REMS: </b>Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.AbecmaREMS.com&amp;esheet=52468815&amp;newsitemid=20210819005501&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.AbecmaREMS.com&amp;index=3&amp;md5=dd3fb0d338f239b039ff8de401f112a6"" rel=""nofollow"">www.AbecmaREMS.com</a> or 1-888-423-5436.

<b>Hypersensitivity Reactions: </b>Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA.

<b>Infections: </b>ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 70% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 23% of patients. Overall, 4 patients had Grade 5 infections (3%); 2 patients (1.6%) had Grade 5 events of pneumonia, 1 patient (0.8%) had Grade 5 bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 1 patient (0.8%) had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, preemptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia was observed in 16% (20/127) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.

<i>Viral Reactivation</i>: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

<b>Prolonged Cytopenias:</b> Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and ABECMA infusion. In the KarMMa study, 41% of patients (52/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 49% (62/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. Rate of prolonged neutropenia was 49% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 34% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. In 83% (43/52) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 65% (40/62) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 2.1 months. Median time to cytopenia recovery was similar across the 300 and 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> dose cohort.

Three patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. Two of the three patients died from complications of prolonged cytopenia. Monitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support according to institutional guidelines.

<b>Hypogammaglobulinemia: </b>Plasma cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with ABECMA. Hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 21% (27/127) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dl after infusion in 25% (32/127) of patients treated with ABECMA.

Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG &lt;400 mg/dl. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis.

The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA.

<b>Secondary Malignancies: </b>Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. If a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing of secondary malignancy of T cell origin.

<b>Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: </b>Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

<b>Adverse Reactions: </b>The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) include CRS, infections – pathogen unspecified, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, edema, pyrexia, cough, headache, and decreased appetite.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for lenacapavir, an investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, has been fully validated and is now under evaluation with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The proposed indication is for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), in adults with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who are currently on a failing antiretroviral treatment regimen due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations.

The application will be reviewed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under the centralized licensing procedure for all 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

“Lenacapavir is a breakthrough innovation that has the potential to be transformative for people with multi-drug resistant HIV, who have very limited treatment options,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “The MAA validation is a step forward in our commitment to a patient-centered approach to helping all individuals living with HIV achieve and sustain viral load suppression, irrespective of their prior treatment history.”

The MAA is supported by data from the ongoing CAPELLA study, which achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a significantly higher proportion of participants randomly allocated to receive oral lenacapavir in combination with an optimized background regimen (n=24) achieved a clinically meaningful viral load reduction of at least 0.5 log10 copies/mL from baseline compared with those randomly allocated to receive placebo (n=12) during the 14-day functional monotherapy period (88% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.0001). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to study drug and no study drug discontinuations through the 14-day period, including no discontinuations due to adverse events. The most common adverse events observed were injection site reactions. These data were previously <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fnews-and-press%2Fpress-room%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F3%2Fgileads-investigational-lenacapavir-demonstrates-sustained-long-acting-efficacy-through-week-26-in-data-presented-at-croi&amp;esheet=52479642&amp;newsitemid=20210819005756&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=presented&amp;index=1&amp;md5=0f039e003888fec6cd688678808f3f49"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">presented</a> at the virtual 28th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (<i>virtual</i> CROI 2021). 26-week data from the CAPELLA study were <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gilead.com%2Fnews-and-press%2Fpress-room%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F7%2Fnew-phase-3-data-support-the-sustained-longacting-efficacy-of-lenacapavir-gileads-investigational-hiv1-capsid-inhibitor&amp;esheet=52479642&amp;newsitemid=20210819005756&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=presented&amp;index=2&amp;md5=11846b22da2e9f21f924241d0be46ee6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">presented</a> at the 11th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science. Additional data from the CAPELLA study will be presented at a future scientific conference.

In May 2019, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the development of lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced patients with multi-drug resistance in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.

Lenacapavir is an investigational compound and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use; its safety and efficacy are not established. There is no cure for HIV or AIDS.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CAPELLA (NCT04150068)</span></b>

CAPELLA is a Phase 2/3, double-blinded, placebo-controlled global multi-center study designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of Gilead’s investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor lenacapavir administered every six months as a subcutaneous injection in heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. CAPELLA includes men and women living with HIV-1 and is being conducted at research centers in North America, Europe and Asia.

In CAPELLA, 36 participants with multi-class HIV-1 drug resistance and a detectable viral load while on a failing regimen were randomly allocated to receive oral lenacapavir or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for 14 days, in addition to continuing their failing regimen (functional monotherapy). An additional 36 participants were enrolled in a separate treatment cohort, starting oral lenacapavir on Day 1. Both cohorts are part of the ongoing maintenance period of the study evaluating the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous lenacapavir administered every six months in combination with an optimized background regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants randomly allocated to receive lenacapavir or placebo for 14 days, in addition to continuing their failing regimen, achieving ≥0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL reduction from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the end of the functional monotherapy period. Following 14 days of lenacapavir oral therapy, all participants started open-label lenacapavir, administered as a subcutaneous injection every six months, in combination with an optimized background regimen. This ongoing maintenance period of the study is evaluating the additional trial endpoints of safety and efficacy of subcutaneous lenacapavir administered every six months in combination with an optimized background regimen.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Lenacapavir</span></b>

Lenacapavir is a potential first-in-class, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor in development for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The safety and efficacy of lenacapavir are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical studies. Lenacapavir's multi-stage mechanism of action is distinguishable from currently approved classes of antiviral agents and is designed to provide a new avenue for the development of long-acting therapy options for people living with HIV-1. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, lenacapavir is designed to inhibit HIV-1 at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross resistance to other existing drug classes.

<strong>TOKYO, August 20, 2021</strong> – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") and FibroGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: FGEN, CEO: Enrique Conterno, ""FibroGen"") today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved EVRENZOTM (roxadustat) for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

“We are very pleased EVRENZO has been approved as the first oral HIF-PH inhibitor to treat adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with CKD in the European Union,” said Steven Benner, M.D., M.H.S., President of Development, Astellas. “Today’s approval provides patients, regardless of dialysis status, with a first-in-class treatment option to address the multifaceted nature of this condition. We look forward to making roxadustat available to adult patients with anemia of CKD in countries across the European Union.”

CKD impacts one in 10 people globally, of whom one in five are affected by anemia.<sup>1, 2 </sup>Anemia of CKD is often untreated or not treated to target, and is associated with reduced quality of life and progression to adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes.<sup>3-5 </sup>

“Anemia is a significant and early complication of CKD that occurs with greater frequency and impact as CKD worsens, affecting patients’ day-to-day living, self-care and mobility,” said Jonathan Barratt, Ph.D., FRCP, Consultant Nephrologist and the Mayer Professor of Renal Medicine at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. “This approval represents a step forward in providing patients with an efficient and simple option to manage anemia symptoms and maintain target hemoglobin levels to minimize the impact on their quality of life.”

Roxadustat is the first orally administered HIF-PH inhibitor available in the European Union. Roxadustat increases hemoglobin (Hb) levels through a different mechanism of action compared to injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) which are typically co-administered with intravenous iron. As a HIF-PH inhibitor, roxadustat activates the body’s natural response to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This response involves the regulation of multiple, coordinated processes that allow management of anemia with a reduced use of intravenous iron.

“HIF-PH inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of anemia of CKD,” said Mark Eisner, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, FibroGen. “Roxadustat provides a novel breakthrough for patients who suffer from this condition.”

This approval follows the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) positive opinion to authorize roxadustat in June6 based on results from a comprehensive pivotal Phase 3 program comprising of eight multicenter and randomized studies, which involved 9,600 patients worldwide.<sup>7-12</sup> The results of this program showed roxadustat was efficacious in achieving and maintaining target Hb levels (10-12g/dL) in patients with symptomatic anemia of CKD regardless of dialysis status and irrespective of prior ESA treatment.<sup>7-11</sup> The safety profile observed in the roxadustat development program is reflective of the CKD populations studied and comparable to ESAs.<sup>7-12</sup>

The EC has the authority to approve medicines for European Union member states, as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein.<sup>13</sup>

The EC approval of roxadustat triggers a milestone payment of $120 million by Astellas to FibroGen, and FibroGen will also receive royalties based upon European net sales.

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 19, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced preliminary data from the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study evaluating RYBREVANT<sup>TM </sup>(amivantamab-vmjw) for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations. The initial data showed anti-tumor activity in patients with METex14 mutations and a safety profile consistent with reported experience at the approved CHRYSALIS Phase 2 dose (RYBREVANT<sup>TM</sup> 1050 mg [&lt;80 kg] / 1400 mg [≥80 kg]).<sup>1</sup> These findings will be featured at the virtual International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's (IASLC) 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) taking place from <span class=""xn-chron"">September 8-14</span> in <span class=""xn-location"">Denver</span> as an oral presentation (Abstract #OA15.03).

METex14 mutations are found in approximately three percent of patients with NSCLC.<sup>2</sup> These genetic alterations result in hyperactivation of the MET receptor with corresponding cancer cell growth.<sup>3</sup> While MET inhibitors have recently received accelerated approval in this setting in some regions, the vast majority of patients eventually acquire resistance to these therapies, thus underscoring the need for new treatment options.<sup>4</sup><sup>,5,6</sup>

""Newer treatment advances for non-small cell lung cancer provide benefit to patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations, but because they are effective for only a finite period of time, patients ultimately find themselves in need of new therapies,"" said Alexander Spira, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Director of the Virginia Cancer Specialists Research Institute, Co-Chair U.S. Oncology Thoracic Program and presenting study investigator<sup>†</sup>. ""We look forward to sharing these latest results for amivantamab that suggest its novel mechanism of action may be of benefit to people living with this type of lung cancer.""

In the METex14 cohort of the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, 19 patients with this genetic alteration received intravenous RYBREVANT<sup>TM</sup> 1050 mg (for patients who weigh &lt;80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients who weigh ≥80 kg).<sup>1</sup> Disease response was evaluated using overall response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1* (RECIST v1.1) as the primary endpoint.<sup>1</sup> Of the 14 response-evaluable patients, partial responses were observed in 64 percent with four patients pending confirmation.<sup>1</sup> Activity was observed in treatment-naïve and previously-treated patients, including four of seven patients previously treated with MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).<sup>1</sup> The median time to first response was 4.1 months (range, 1.6–9.9).<sup>1</sup>

The majority of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1-2.<sup>1</sup> Treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs were observed in three patients (16 percent), which included dyspnea (N=1), hypoalbuminemia (N=1) and rash (N=1).<sup>1</sup> The incidence of treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction and discontinuation was 11 percent and five percent, respectively.<sup>1</sup> Dose interruptions occurred in 32 percent of patients.<sup>1</sup>

In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2021</span>, RYBREVANT<sup>TM</sup> received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations, based on data showing an ORR of 40 percent (95 percent CI, 29 – 51) and median duration of response of 11.1 months (95 percent CI, 6.9 – NE).<sup>7</sup>

""While the recent FDA approval of RYBREVANT was an important milestone for patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, there continues to be a lack of long-term treatment options for patients with other mutations, including MET exon 14 skipping mutations,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kiran Patel</span>, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development, Solid Tumors, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We are encouraged by these data showing evidence that RYBREVANT<sup>TM</sup> can lead to broad activity against both EGFR and MET-driven tumors.""

<b>RYBREVANT™</b> <b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b><sup>7</sup><b><br class=""dnr"" /></b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Infusion Related Reactions</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>RYBREVANT™ can cause infusion related reactions (IRR); signs and symptoms of IRR include dyspnea, flushing, fever, chills, nausea, chest discomfort, hypotension, and vomiting.

Based on the safety population, IRR occurred in 66% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™. Among patients receiving treatment on Week 1 Day 1, 65% experienced an IRR, while the incidence of IRR was 3.4% with the Day 2 infusion, 0.4% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 1.1% with subsequent infusions. Of the reported IRRs, 97% were Grade 1-2, 2.2% were Grade 3, and 0.4% were Grade 4. The median time to onset was 1 hour (range 0.1 to 18 hours) after start of infusion. The incidence of infusion modifications due to IRR was 62% and 1.3% of patients permanently discontinued RYBREVANT™ due to IRR.

Premedicate with antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids and infuse RYBREVANT™ as recommended. Administer RYBREVANT™ via a peripheral line on Week 1 and Week 2. Monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during RYBREVANT™ infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available. Interrupt infusion if IRR is suspected. Reduce the infusion rate or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.

<b>Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>RYBREVANT™ can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Based on the safety population, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™, with 0.7% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis. Three patients (1%) discontinued RYBREVANT™ due to ILD/pneumonitis.

Monitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold RYBREVANT™ in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.

<b>Dermatologic Adverse Reactions</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>RYBREVANT™ can cause rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus and dry skin. Based on the safety population, rash occurred in 74% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™, including Grade 3 rash in 3.3% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 14 days (range: 1 to 276 days). Rash leading to dose reduction occurred in 5% of patients, and RYBREVANT™ was permanently discontinued due to rash in 0.7% of patients.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in one patient (0.3%) treated with RYBREVANT™.

Instruct patients to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment with RYBREVANT™. Advise patients to wear protective clothing and use broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen. Alcohol free emollient cream is recommended for dry skin.

If skin reactions develop, start topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics. For Grade 3 reactions, add oral steroids and consider dermatologic consultation. Promptly refer patients presenting with severe rash, atypical appearance or distribution, or lack of improvement within 2 weeks to a dermatologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.

<b>Ocular Toxicity</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>RYBREVANT™ can cause ocular toxicity including keratitis, dry eye symptoms, conjunctival redness, blurred vision, visual impairment, ocular itching, and uveitis. Based on the safety population, keratitis occurred in 0.7% and uveitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with RYBREVANT™. All events were Grade 1-2. Promptly refer patients presenting with eye symptoms to an ophthalmologist. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue RYBREVANT™ based on severity.

<b>Embryo Fetal Toxicity</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal models, RYBREVANT™ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of RYBREVANT™.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b><sup>7<br class=""dnr"" /></sup>The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were rash, IRR, paronychia, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, edema, stomatitis, cough, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased phosphate, decreased potassium, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased glucose, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, and decreased sodium.

Positive high-level results from the PROVENT Phase III pre-exposure prophylaxis trial showed AstraZeneca's AZD7442 achieved a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, the trial's primary endpoint.

AZD7442, a combination of two long-acting antibodies (LAAB), reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 46, 90), compared to placebo. The trial accrued 25 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 at the primary analysis.

There were no cases of severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related deaths in those treated with AZD7442. In the placebo arm, there were three cases of severe COVID-19, which included two deaths.

AZD7442 is the first antibody combination (non-vaccine) modified to potentially provide long-lasting protection that has demonstrated prevention of COVID-19 in a clinical trial.

The trial included 5,197 participants in a 2:1 randomisation AZD7442 to placebo. The primary analysis was based on 5,172 participants who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline.

More than 75% of participants had co-morbidities, which include conditions that have been reported to cause a reduced immune response to vaccination.

The LAAB was well tolerated and preliminary analyses show adverse events were balanced between the placebo and AZD7442 groups.

Myron J. Levin, MD, Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, US, and principal investigator on the trial, said: “The PROVENT data show that one dose of AZD7442, delivered in a convenient intramuscular form, can quickly and effectively prevent symptomatic COVID-19. With these exciting results, AZD7442 could be an important tool in our arsenal to help people who may need more than a vaccine to return to their normal lives.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “We need additional approaches for individuals who are not adequately protected by COVID-19 vaccines. We are very encouraged by these efficacy and safety data in high-risk people, showing our long-acting antibody combination has the potential to protect from symptomatic and severe disease, alongside vaccines. We look forward to sharing further data from the AZD7442 Phase III clinical trial programme later this year.”

AZD7442 was optimised using AstraZeneca’s proprietary YTE half-life extension technology, which could afford up to 12 months of protection from COVID-19, and is delivered by intramuscular injection.

Preliminary ‘in vitro’ findings from investigators at Oxford University and Columbia University demonstrate that AZD7442 neutralises recent emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, including the Delta variant.<sup>1-6</sup>

AstraZeneca will prepare regulatory submission of the prophylaxis (PROVENT and STORM CHASER) data to health authorities for potential emergency use authorisation or conditional approval of AZD7442. Full results from PROVENT will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

<b>PROVENT
</b>PROVENT is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial assessing the safety and efficacy of a single 300mg dose of AZD7442 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19. The trial was conducted in 87 sites in the US, UK, Spain, France and Belgium. 5,197 participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular (IM) dose of either 300mg of AZD7442 (n = 3460) or saline placebo (n = 1,737), administered in two separate, sequential IM injections.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the first case of any SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive symptomatic illness occurring post dose prior to day 183. Subjects will continue to be followed for 15 months.

Participants were adults 18 years-old and over who would benefit from prevention with the LAAB, defined as having increased risk for inadequate response to active immunisation (predicted poor responders to vaccines or intolerant of vaccine) or having increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those whose locations or circumstances put them at appreciable risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Participants at the time of screening were unvaccinated and had a negative point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 serology test.

Approximately 43% of participants were 60 years and over. In addition, more than 75% had baseline co-morbidities and other characteristics that are associated with an<a id=""_Hlk80196817"" name=""_Hlk80196817""></a> increased risk for severe COVID-19 should they become infected, including those with immunosuppressive disease or taking immunosuppressive medications, diabetes, severe obesity or cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney and chronic liver disease. Approximately 73% were White/Caucasian, 17% Black/African American, and 3% Asian. Approximately 15% of participants were Hispanic.

<b>AZD7442
</b>AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs - tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) - derived from B-cells donated by convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 virus. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/articles/2020/advancing-our-discovery-of-novel-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid-19.html"">licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020</a>, the human monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<sup>7</sup> and were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor and complement C1q binding. The half-life extension more than triples the durability of its action compared to conventional antibodies and could afford up to 12 months of protection from COVID-19 following a single administration.<sup>8-11</sup> The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease - a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.<sup>12</sup>

AZD7442 is being studied in a comprehensive clinical trial programme for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in over 9,000 participants. Ongoing trials include <a href=""https://www.tackle-covid-19.com/en-US/"" rel=""link-confirmation"">TACKLE COVID-19</a><sup>13</sup>, a Phase III treatment trial in an outpatient setting and collaborator treatment trials in outpatient and hospitalised settings. AZD7442 is being assessed in both IM and intravenous administration routes.

AZD7442 is being developed with support from the US Government, including federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in partnership with the Department of Defense; Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, under Contract No. W911QY-21-9-0001.

AstraZeneca is working with governments around the world to make AZD7442 accessible to high-risk populations as another valuable option in the fight to end COVID-19, should it prove to be effective and well tolerated.

Data published in <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2548-6"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Nature</i></a> in July 2020 showed that in preclinical experiments, the LAABs were able to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.<sup>14</sup>

Under the terms of the licensing agreement with Vanderbilt, AstraZeneca will pay single-digit royalties on future net sales.

Basel, 18 August 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel, advancing the company's commitment to personalised healthcare through tests that determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific and targeted therapies. The VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel is the first companion diagnostic test to aid in identifying patients whose solid tumours are deficient in DNA mismatch repair (MMR), who may be eligible for JEMPERLI (dostarlimab-gxly) monotherapy, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy from GSK. The test evaluates a panel of MMR proteins in tumours to provide important treatment information to clinicians.

MMR is a naturally occurring mechanism that scans our DNA, correcting errors that cause disease. When MMR is deficient (dMMR), cells mutate, which can lead to cancer. While MMR deficiency is most common in endometrial cancer, other high prevalence dMMR tumour types include gastric, colorectal, small intestine, cervical and neuroendocrine cancers. In the U.S., prevalence of dMMR across patients with solid tumours has been estimated at 14 percent.<sup>3</sup> PD-1 inhibitors can be effective treatment in cancers with MMR deficiency.

""As the first companion diagnostic of its kind, this test can help qualify patients with solid tumours that are deficient in MMR who have progressed in their disease and who have no other suitable treatment options,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Based on the results of our MMR biomarker test, these patients may be eligible to receive GSK’s JEMPERLI. We are pleased that our innovative companion diagnostic label continues to grow to serve more patients.”

FDA approval of the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel provides clinicians with access to a fully automated panel of MMR biomarkers tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC), enabling impactful treatment decisions for patients. JEMPERLI was approved by the FDA on 17 August 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumours, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication received accelerated approval based on tumour response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may depend on verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).
The VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel and JEMPERLI were earlier approved by the FDA <a title=""for use in endometrial cancer"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=INKTAq9ZgHUl0xXLys-XWEqFHTPzbs8zBL5UGcmS7LMoFvL7HvnLTn25uOFGXYKzXvzF6-34MLGtP8HbJ5i-Eih57u-lmae08aWw2Un_YKuQ1BkKL19bygn-P4E7dgm_75LWFtsWdUY7ubWqSoHH_w=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">for use in endometrial cancer</a> in April 2021.

<strong>A</strong><strong>bout the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel</strong>
The VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel is a label expansion of Roche’s current on-market VENTANA MMR IHC Panel. The VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel is intended for the assessment of expression of MMR proteins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue stained with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit and ancillary reagents in the panel for VENTANA anti-MLH1 (M1), VENTANA anti-MSH2 (G219-1129) and VENTANA anti-MSH6 (SP93) and OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit with the OptiView Amplification Kit and ancillary reagents for VENTANA anti-PMS2 (A16-4) on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins have been clinically proven to be predictive biomarkers for PD-1 targeted therapy; specifically, a loss of expression of one or more MMR proteins might predict an increased likelihood of response to such therapy.<sup>4,5,6</sup> PD-1 inhibitors can be effective in cancers with MMR deficiency.<sup>4,6</sup> MMR is a conserved molecular mechanism that functions to correct the improper base substitutions that spontaneously occur during DNA replication. Defects in the MMR machinery have been attributed to mutations in the MMR proteins.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that <i>Opdivo<sup>®</sup></i>(nivolumab) 240 mg every two weeks or 480 mg every four weeks (injection for intravenous use) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection, regardless of prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nodal involvement or PD-L1 status.<sup>1</sup> The approval is based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial, which compared <i>Opdivo</i> 240 mg (n=353) to placebo (n=356).<sup>1</sup> This application was approved under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.<sup>2</sup>

In the trial, among patients who received <i>Opdivo, </i>median disease-free survival (DFS) was nearly twice as long as in those who received placebo (20.8 months [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 16.5 to 27.6] versus 10.8 months [95% CI: 8.3 to 13.9]).<sup>1</sup><i>Opdivo </i>reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 30% compared to placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.86; <i>P</i>=0.0008).<sup>1</sup> Among patients whose tumors express PD-L1 ≥1%, median DFS was not reached (95% CI: 21.2 to NE; n=140) for those who received <i>Opdivo</i> versus 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.6 to 21.2; n=142) for placebo; <i>Opdivo </i>reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 45% (HR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.77; <i>P</i>=0.0005).<sup>1</sup>

“This approval is a major milestone for patients who have undergone major surgery to remove the bladder or parts of the urinary tract and are in need of additional treatment approaches that can help reduce the risk of their UC returning,” said Matthew D. Galsky,* M.D., a CheckMate -274 primary investigator and Professor of Medicine, Director of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, Co-Director of the Center of Excellence for Bladder Cancer, and Associate Director for Translational Research at The Tisch Cancer Institute and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.<sup>3</sup> “Nivolumab<i></i>provides a new FDA-approved treatment shown to reduce the risk of disease recurrence or death based on the safety and efficacy findings from CheckMate -274, and has the potential to become a new standard of care option in this setting.”<sup>1</sup>

<i>Opdivo</i> is associated with the following Warnings &amp; Precautions: severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis and hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathies, dermatologic adverse reactions, nephritis with renal dysfunction, other immune-mediated adverse reactions; infusion-related reactions; complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); embryo-fetal toxicity; and increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when <i>Opdivo</i> is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone, which is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.<sup>1</sup> Please see Important Safety Information below.

“At Bristol Myers Squibb, our leading research in immunotherapy has helped transform the way many cancers are treated, and we are continuing to bring these advancements to patients with earlier stages of disease, particularly in challenging cancers with significant unmet need,” said Adam Lenkowsky, senior vice president and general manager, U.S. Cardiovascular, Immunology and Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb. “UC is the third type of cancer where <i>Opdivo </i>has been the first approved PD-1 inhibitor in the adjuvant setting. Now with this advancement, we can offer new hope to the conversations between healthcare providers and their UC patients where historically no approved treatment options have existed to help prevent disease recurrence post-surgery.”<sup>1</sup>

The results from the CheckMate -274 trial are confirmatory evidence for <i>Opdivo’s</i> accelerated approval for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy received in February 2017. These results support conversion of <i>Opdivo’s</i> accelerated approval to a regular approval in this setting.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -274</span></b>

CheckMate -274 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial evaluating <i>Opdivo</i> as an adjuvant treatment in patients who had undergone radical resection of urothelial carcinoma (UC) originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract and were at high risk of recurrence.<sup>1</sup> The UC pathologic staging criteria that defines high risk patients was ypT2-ypT4a or ypN+ for patients who received neoadjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy or pT3-pT4a or pN+ for patients who did not receive neoadjuvant cisplatin and who also either were ineligible for or refused adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy.<sup>1</sup>

Patients were randomized (n=353 and n=356 to the <i>Opdivo</i> and placebo arms, respectively) to receive <i>Opdivo</i> 240 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every two weeks until recurrence or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum treatment duration of one year.<sup>1</sup> Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to <i>Opdivo</i> or placebo and were stratified by pathologic nodal status (N+ vs. N0/x with &lt;10 nodes removed vs. N0 with ≥10 nodes removed), tumor cells expressing PD-L1 (≥1% vs. &lt;1%/indeterminate as determined by the central lab using the PD L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay), and use of neoadjuvant cisplatin (yes vs. no).<sup>1</sup> The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed DFS in all randomized patients and in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 ≥1%.<sup>1</sup> DFS was defined as time to first recurrence (local urothelial tract, local non-urothelial tract, or distant metastasis), or death.<sup>1</sup> Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival.<sup>1</sup> The FDA-approved dosing for <i>Opdivo</i> is 240 mg every two weeks (30-minute intravenous infusion) or 480 mg every four weeks (30-minute intravenous infusion) until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity for up to one year.<sup>1</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Select Safety Profile from CheckMate -274 Study</span></b>

Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of <i>Opdivo</i> occurred in 18% of patients.<sup>1</sup><i>Opdivo</i> was delayed for adverse reaction in 33% of patients.<sup>1</sup> Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving <i>Opdivo</i>.<sup>1</sup> The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reaction in patients receiving <i>Opdivo</i> was urinary tract infection.<sup>1</sup> Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1% of patients and included pneumonitis (0.6%).<sup>1</sup> The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were rash (36%), fatigue (36%), diarrhea (30%), pruritus (30%), musculoskeletal pain (28%), and urinary tract infection (22%).<sup>1</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Urothelial Carcinoma</span></b>

Urothelial carcinoma (UC), which most frequently begins in the cells that line the inside of the bladder, is the most common type of bladder cancer in adults in the United States.<sup>4</sup> Each year, 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed and a majority of those cases are UC.<sup>4,5</sup> In addition to the bladder, UC can occur in other parts of the urinary tract, including the ureter and renal pelvis.<sup>4</sup> Although UC can be diagnosed early, the rates of recurrence and disease progression can be high.<sup>6,7</sup> The survival rate can vary depending on the stage and other factors when diagnosed; for patients with metastatic UC, the prognosis is often poor.<sup>5,8</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">INDICATIONS</span></b>

OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection of UC.

OPDIVO<sup>® </sup>(nivolumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection.

OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer with residual pathologic disease in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity</span>

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

OPDIVO can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.7% (54/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (&lt;0.1%) and Grade 2 (1.2%).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (163/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (4.8%).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, diabetes occurred in 0.9% (17/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.3%), and 2 cases of diabetic ketoacidosis.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction</span>

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated nephritis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 1.2% (23/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.5%), and Grade 2 (0.6%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions</span>

OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information).

In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated rash occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.1%) and Grade 2 (2.2%).

<span class=""bwuline"">Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</span>

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: <i>cardiac/vascular:</i> myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; <i>nervous system:</i> meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; <i>ocular:</i> uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>musculoskeletal and connective tissue:</i> myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>endocrine:</i> hypoparathyroidism; <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>

In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

<b>Lactation</b>

There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Serious Adverse Reactions</b>

In Checkmate 274, serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=351). The most frequent serious adverse reaction reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO was urinary tract infection. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1% of patients; these included events of pneumonitis (0.6%). In Checkmate 275, serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=270).

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC).
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Treatment options for NPC, one of the most common head and neck cancers in China and many parts of Asia, are limited, with chemotherapy continuing to dominate front-line care. Supported by the positive RATIONALE 309 trial, the NMPA acceptance of this sBLA, which is the ninth for tislelizumab in China, represents an incredible milestone in its development history and serves as a validation of this potentially differentiated checkpoint inhibitor,” commented Yong (Ben) Ben, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Immuno-Oncology at BeiGene. “We look forward to bringing this important immunotherapy to the underserved NPC patient community in China.”

The sBLA is supported by clinical results from a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial RATIONALE 309 (NCT03924986) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin versus placebo combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC. The primary endpoint of this trial is progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), and investigator-assessed PFS. A total of 263 Asian patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either the tislelizumab plus chemotherapy arm or the placebo plus chemotherapy arm.

As announced in May 2021, RATIONALE 309 met the primary endpoint of PFS at the planned interim analysis. The safety profile of tislelizumab was consistent with its known risks, with no new safety signals identified with the addition of chemotherapy. BeiGene expects to present results from the RATIONALE 309 trial at an upcoming medical conference.

<b>About Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC)</b>

Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a malignant, squamous cell carcinoma which arises from the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx, most commonly originating in the pharyngeal recess (the fossa of Rosenmüller).<sup>i</sup> There were an estimated 62,555 new cases of NPC in China in 2020, accounting for 46.8 percent of the worldwide incidence.<sup>ii</sup> Despite the heavy public health burden of NPC in southern China and other endemic areas, relatively little is known about the etiology and prevention of NPC.<sup>iii</sup> The major risk factors for NPC are genetic predisposition, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and consumption of salt-preserved food.<sup>iv</sup> The median overall survival rate is about 20 months in advanced NPC;<sup>v</sup> however, progressively worsening prognoses falling to a three-year survival of 7-40% were reported in patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC, indicating a high medical unmet need for more effective treatment.<sup>vi,vii,viii</sup>

<b>About Tislelizumab</b>

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologics program and is being developed internationally as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.

The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted tislelizumab approval in five indications, including full approval for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy and for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy; and conditional approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) who received at least two prior therapies, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy, and for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received at least one systemic therapy. Full approval for these indications is contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials.

In addition, four supplemental Biologics License Applications for tislelizumab have been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA and are under review for second- or third-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy, for patients with previously treated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) solid tumors, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have disease progression following or are intolerant to first-line standard chemotherapy, and for first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC).

BeiGene has initiated or completed 17 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials in China and globally, including 13 Phase 3 trials and four pivotal Phase 2 trials.

In January 2021, BeiGene and Novartis entered into a collaboration and license agreement granting Novartis rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Europe, and Japan.

Tislelizumab is not approved for use outside of China.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved XELJANZ<sup>®</sup> (tofacitinib) for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients two years of age and older who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Two formulations were approved, a tablet and a new oral solution (weight-based dosing). XELJANZ is the first and only Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA and has received regulatory approval in four indications in the European Union, the most of any JAK inhibitor.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

In addition, the EC has approved XELJANZ prolonged-release 11 mg once-daily tablets for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate or other DMARDs. This once-daily treatment is an alternative to the currently approved XELJANZ 5 mg twice-daily treatment of PsA.

“Many patients living with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis require an injection or an infusion when receiving treatment, which can be challenging for both these children and their caretakers,” said Ana Paula Carvalho, International Developed Markets Regional President, Inflammation &amp; Immunology at Pfizer. “We are proud to make these new options available in the EU as Pfizer continues to advance the science and understanding of medicines like XELJANZ, which has been studied in more than 50 trials across clinical programs worldwide.”

JIA is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology and is defined as arthritis that begins before 16 years of age and persists for at least six weeks. Polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA are subtypes of JIA. The polyarticular JIA subtype is characterized by arthritis in five or more joints and affects both the small joints of the hands and feet and large joints like the knees, hips and ankles.<sup>i</sup> People living with the juvenile PsA subtype can have joint symptoms and a scaly rash of the skin.<sup>i</sup> It is estimated that JIA impacts approximately 60,000 children in Europe.<sup>ii</sup>

PsA in adults is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease that may include inflammation in peripheral joints, tendons or skin.<sup>iii </sup>PsA may include a variety of symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, swollen toes and/or fingers and reduced range of motion.<sup>iv</sup>

<b>About the JIA Study</b>

The polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA approval is based on data from a Phase 3 pivotal study in patients with polyarticular JIA as well as other JIA subtypes, including juvenile PsA. The study had two phases: an 18-week open-label, run-in phase (including 225 patients), followed by a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, withdrawal phase (including 173 patients) for a total duration of 44 weeks. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib taken as either a 5 mg tablet or as a 1 mg/mL oral solution twice daily based on the subject’s body weight (&lt;40 kg for the oral solution) and/or patient preference. The trial met its primary endpoint showing that in patients with polyarticular JIA who achieved a JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response at the end of the run-in phase, the occurrence of disease flare in patients treated with tofacitinib (31 percent; n/M=27/88) was statistically significant (p=0.0007) lower than patients treated with placebo (55 percent; n/N=47/85) at week 44. Efficacy in the juvenile PsA subtype population was consistent with polyarticular JIA. In this study, disease flare was defined as a 30 percent or more worsening in at least three of the six variables of the JIA ACR core set, with no more than one of the remaining JIA core response variables improving by 30 percent or more (outcome measures used in JIA clinical trials) after randomization.<sup>v,vi,vii</sup>

In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA were consistent with the known safety profile of XELJANZ. Please see important safety information below.

<b>About XELJANZ<sup>®</sup> (tofacitinib) and XELJANZ Prolonged Release</b>

XELJANZ (film-coated immediate release tablet, twice daily dosing) is the first and only oral JAK inhibitor approved in the European Union in four indications: adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after DMARD failure or intolerance, adults with active PsA after DMARD failure or intolerance, adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent, and active polyarticular JIA and juvenile PsA in patients two years of age and older who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with DMARDs. See Limitations of Use below. In addition, in the European Union, the prolonged release tablet is approved as a once-daily treatment alternative for RA and PsA.

XELJANZ has been studied in more than 50 clinical trials worldwide, including more than 20 trials in RA patients, and prescribed to over 300,000 adult patients (the majority of whom were RA patients) worldwide since 2012.<sup>viii,ix,x </sup>As the developer of tofacitinib, Pfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of tofacitinib through robust clinical development programs in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.

In June 2021, the Committee for Medicine Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.pfizer.com%2Fpfizercom%2F2021-06%2FXeljanz_PRAC_Media_Statement_Final.pdf%3FGWTBB3xxKCiPZWGvzgODNxjjNj79AZ8T&amp;esheet=52480185&amp;newsitemid=20210820005354&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=recommendation&amp;index=1&amp;md5=52c24de0873560e2ea2922db44eb1f0c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">recommendation</a> from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee following its review of XELJANZ in the European Union, which states that in patients over 65 years of age, patients who are current or past smokers, patients with other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and patients with other malignancy risk factors, XELJANZ should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. The CHMP-endorsed PRAC recommendation is applicable to all EU member states and is in the process of being implemented in the XELJANZ summary of product characteristics.

Pfizer is also continuing to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies to review the full results and analysis of the ORAL Surveillance data that has formed the basis of this CHMP-endorsed PRAC recommendation.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</b>

<b>Patients treated with XELJANZ* are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.</b>

<b>If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the infection is controlled.</b>

<b>Reported infections include:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before XELJANZ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to XELJANZ use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections, or with chronic or recurrent infection.

In the UC population, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily.

<b>The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection, </b>or those who have lived or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses. Viral reactivation including herpes virus and hepatitis B reactivation have been reported. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy.

<b>Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>

Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infection.

<b>MORTALITY</b>

<b>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular (CV) risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day had a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden CV death, compared to those treated with XELJANZ 5 mg given twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing, postmarketing safety study. </b>XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA. For UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response.

<b>MALIGNANCIES</b>

<b>Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ.</b>

<b>Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications.</b>

Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a malignancy.

Malignancies (including solid cancers and lymphomas) were observed more often in patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily dosing in the UC long-term extension study.

Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

<b>THROMBOSIS</b>

<b>Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. RA patients who were 50 years of age and older with at least one CV risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing postmarketing safety study had an observed increase in incidence of these events. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death. Avoid XELJANZ in patients at risk. Discontinue XELJANZ and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis. For patients with UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response. </b>XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA. In a long-term extension study in UC, four cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer.<b></b>

<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS</b>

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in XELJANZ clinical trials, although the role of JAK inhibition is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs).

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY</b>

Angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ and some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction.

<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES</b>

<b>Lymphocyte Abnormalities: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean lymphocyte counts. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a count less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Neutropenia: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Anemia: </b>Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a hemoglobin level less than 9 g/dL. Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

<b>Liver Enzyme Elevations: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

<b>Lipid Elevations: </b>Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. Manage patients with hyperlipidemia according to clinical guidelines. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.

<b>VACCINATIONS</b>

Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.

<b>PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL NARROWING</b>

Caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended release formulation.

<b>HEPATIC and RENAL IMPAIRMENT</b>

Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.

For patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg once daily.

For UC patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>

The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials in patients with RA with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and placebo, respectively, (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ with or without DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and hypertension. The safety profile observed in patients with active PsA treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA patients.

Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials for UC were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster.

<b>USE IN PREGNANCY</b>

Available data with XELJANZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and UC in pregnancy. In animal studies, tofacitinib at 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily demonstrated adverse embryo-fetal findings. The relevance of these findings to women of childbearing potential is uncertain. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.

* Unless otherwise stated, “XELJANZ” in the Important Safety Information refers to XELJANZ, XELJANZ XR, and XELJANZ Oral Solution.

ZyCoV-D is a three dose vaccine which will be administered first on day zero, day 28th and then on the 56th day. With this approval, <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> now has its first COVID-19 vaccine for the adolescents in the 12-18 age group, besides the adult population. ZyCoV-D, is a needle-free vaccine administered using The PharmaJet<sup>®</sup> a needle free applicator, which ensures painless intradermal vaccine delivery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is for the first time that a technologically advanced vaccine has been successfully developed on the Plasmid DNA platform for human use. The platform because of its rapid plug and play technology can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring. The company plans to manufacture 10-<span class=""xn-money"">12 crore</span> doses of ZyCoV-D annually.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Speaking on this development, Mr. <span class=""xn-person"">Pankaj R. Patel</span>, Chairman, Cadila Healthcare Ltd., said: ""This is a historic milestone with ZyCoV-D, a product of Indian innovation becoming the world's first DNA vaccine being offered for human use and supporting the world's largest immunization drive. We are particularly happy that our vaccine will contribute to this fight against COVID-19 and enable the country to vaccinate a larger population especially in the age group of 12-18 years. I would like to thank all the researchers, clinical trial investigators, volunteers and the regulators who have supported this endeavour.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The company also plans to seek approval for the two dose regimen of the vaccine. The main advantage of DNA vaccines is their ability to stimulate both the humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system. They are a valuable form of antigen-specific immunotherapy, as they are safe, stable and can be easily produced.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This decision is based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), following their review of data from a pre-specified interim analysis. The IDMC recommended that the trial be discontinued due to lack of efficacy. No new safety findings were observed and the data were consistent with the established safety profile of <i>Ultomiris</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ALS is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons (a type of nerve cell that controls voluntary movements) in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gianluca Pirozzi, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, Head of Development and Safety, Alexion, said: ""We are disappointed by this outcome and what it means for patients with this devastating disease. We would like to thank the entire ALS community as well as investigators and healthcare professionals who dedicated their time and expertise to this trial. We continue to be confident in the potential of targeting C5 for complement-driven diseases and remain fully committed to our efforts to serve the rare disease community.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Patients who enrolled in the trial will discontinue study medication and complete any necessary follow-up evaluations. Data from the trial will be provided to inform ongoing research.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>ALS
</b>ALS is a neurological disorder characterised by progressive degeneration of nerve cells (motor neurons) in the brain and the spinal cord that control muscles throughout the body. When the nerve cells die, the brain can no longer initiate and control muscle movement, which results in severe disability, paralysis and eventually death. ALS is a relentlessly progressive disorder. People with ALS may lose the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe. The rate of progression between individuals is variable and the natural history generally reflects progressive worsening over time until death occurs. The average life expectancy from symptom onset is between two and five years. Currently approved medications may slow disease progression, but ALS management is mostly supportive, palliative and symptom based.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>CHAMPION-ALS
</b>The CHAMPION-ALS Phase III trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre global trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <i>Ultomiris </i>across a broad ALS population. The trial enrolled 382 adults with sporadic or familial ALS who had disease onset (in the form of first motor symptoms) within the prior 36 months, demonstrated a slow vital capacity (SVC) of at least 65 percent predicted, and were not dependent on respiratory support. The primary endpoint was change in ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Trial participants were randomised on a 2:1 basis to receive <i>Ultomiris</i> or placebo every eight weeks following an initial loading dose. The trial was conducted at approximately 90 clinical trial sites across North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Ultomiris
</i></b><i>Ultomiris</i> (ravulizumab), the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, offers immediate, complete, and sustained complement inhibition. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. <i>Ultomiris </i>is administered intravenously every eight weeks or, for paediatric patients less than 20 kg, every four weeks, following a loading dose. <i>Ultomiris </i>is approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of adults and children (one month of age and older) with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), as well as in the European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with PNH. It is also approved in the US <a id=""_Hlk77256700"" name=""_Hlk77256700""></a>for atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in adult and paediatric (one month of age and older) patients, in the EU for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with aHUS, as well as in Japan for adults and children with aHUS.</p>

NEW YORK &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Trillium Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ/TSX: TRIL) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will acquire all outstanding shares of Trillium not already owned by Pfizer for an implied equity value of $2.26 billion, or $18.50 per share, in cash. This represents a 118% premium to the 60-day weighted average price for Trillium.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005192/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005192/en/</a></p>
Trillium’s portfolio includes biologics that are designed to enhance the ability of patients’ innate immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. Its two lead molecules, TTI-622 and TTI-621, block the signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα)–CD47 axis, which is emerging as a key immune checkpoint in hematological malignancies. TTI-622 and TTI-621 are novel, potentially best-in-class SIRPα-Fc fusion proteins that are currently in Phase 1b/2 development across several indications, with a focus on hematological malignancies.

“Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to pursue scientific breakthroughs with the addition of potentially best-in-class molecules to our innovative pipeline,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President &amp; General Manager, Pfizer Oncology. “The proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our deep experience in understanding the science of blood cancers, along with the diverse knowledge base we have developed across our growing hematology portfolio of eight approved and investigational therapies, provide us with a foundation to advance these important potential medicines to patients who need them.”

Hematological malignancies are cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. This classification includes various types of leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. More than 1 million people worldwide were diagnosed with a blood cancer in 2020, representing almost 6% of all cancer diagnoses globally. In 2020, more than 700,000 people worldwide died from a form of blood cancer.

“We’re delighted to announce Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Trillium. Today’s announcement reflects Trillium’s potentially best in class SIRPα–CD47 status and contribution to immuno-oncology,” said Dr. Jan Skvarka, Chief Executive Officer of Trillium. “Trillium has the only known SIRPα–CD47 targeting molecules with clinically meaningful monotherapy responses as well as a strong basis for combination therapies, which is supported by preclinical evidence with a diverse set of therapeutic agents. With Pfizer’s global reach and deep capabilities, we believe our programs will advance more quickly to the patients we’ve always aspired to serve. We believe this is a good outcome for patients and our shareholders.”

In clinical studies to-date, TTI-622 and TTI-621 have demonstrated activity as monotherapy in relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies, including Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), and other lymphoid malignancies. As of July 26, 2021, Phase 1 data for TTI-622 in 30 response-evaluable patients have shown deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients, including two complete responses (CRs), one lasting over 114 weeks, with responses ongoing. TTI-622 and TTI-621 are currently the only known CD47-targeted molecules that have demonstrated meaningful single agent activity and CRs in multiple hematological malignancies. Thus far, adverse events (AEs) reported with TTI-622 and TTI-621 have been manageable. Related Grade 3 and 4 AEs with TTI-622 were rare and limited to transient cytopenias. In particular, the molecules demonstrate minimal red blood cell binding and few reported cases of anemia, an observed risk with other CD47-targeted approaches. Further data are expected to be shared at a forthcoming medical conference.

“We are encouraged by the early clinical data for TTI-622 and TTI-621 monotherapy for patients with heavily pretreated lymphoid malignancies and early encouraging activity for TTI-622 in patients with multiple myeloma. Just as PD-1 and PD-L1 blockers have proven to be effective immuno-therapeutics for many solid tumors, the SIRPα-CD47 interaction defines a second key immune checkpoint for which disrupting agents are expected to become another important backbone immunotherapy for multiple types of cancer, especially hematological cancers,” said Chris Boshoff, MD, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “Utilizing Pfizer’s leading research and global development capabilities, we plan to accelerate the clinical development of SIRPα fusion proteins as a potential new scientific breakthrough and explore combinations within our own portfolio and with innovative next-generation medicines for hematological malignancies.”

<b>About SIRPα/CD47</b>

Accumulating data suggest that the SIRPα–CD47 axis is a key immune checkpoint in hematologic malignancies, similar to the PD-L1 / PD-1 checkpoint for solid tumors. CD47 is a protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancer cells, and in general, high CD47 expression correlates with more aggressive disease and poorer clinical outcomes. SIRPα is an inhibitory receptor expressed on myeloid cells that binds to CD47, preventing the immune system from destroying cancer cells. Disruption of the CD47-SIRPα interaction has been proven to elicit tumor destruction through triggering of an innate immune response.

63705,PharmaShots Interview: Rain Therapeutic's Avanish Vellanki Shares Insight on the Initiation of P-III MANTRA Trial of Milademetan for Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Avanish Vellanki, CEO and Cofounder at Rain Therapeutics </strong>shared his views on the initiation of the P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate the safety &amp; efficacy of Milademetan for dedifferentiated liposarcoma and provide updates about the company's lead candidate, RAIN-32. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shots: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The company initiates P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate safety &amp; efficacy of milademetan vs trabectedin in a ratio (1:1) in 160 patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without WD LPS that have progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies including at least 1 anthracycline-based therapy</li><li> The 1EPs of a trial is PFS, as assessed by blinded independent review &amp; 2EPs, include OS, ORR, DoR, DCE &amp; investigator-assessed PFS along with safety &amp; PROâ€™s</li><li> The company also provides patients update continuing to receive RAIN-32 as monothx. from the previously completed P-I dose-escalation &amp; expansion study. Additionally, the therapy has received FDAâ€™s ODD for LPS</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Discuss the design of the P-III MANTRA study for DDLPS.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The MANTRA trial (NCT04979442) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care in patients with unresectable or metastatic de-differentiated (DD) liposarcoma (LPS) with or without a well-differentiated (WD) LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Approximately 160 patients are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan &nbsp;or trabectedin. The primary objective of the trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient-reported outcomes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>What makes milademetan unique? Discuss it on behalf of its MoA and other features.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>Milademetan is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) which is oncogenic in numerous cancers. MDM2 is a critical regulator of tumor protein 53 (p53), also known as the â€œguardian of the genomeâ€ because it regulates the cell cycle and is therefore essential for tumor suppression. If MDM2 is overexpressed, p53 can be inactivated, leading to tumor growth and cancer progression. MDM2 inhibition by, milademetan may lead to the reactivation of p53, which can then resume its role in controlling cancer growth. In contrast to many prior generation MDM2 inhibitors, we believe milademetan does not exhibit material drug accumulation in tissues and therefore enabled an optimal dose schedule for efficacy and safety.&nbsp; We believe that a rationally designed dosing schedule in the prior clinical trial takes advantage of these properties of milademetan to demonstrate a potentially more favorable efficacy and safety versus competing for MDM2 programs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Milademetan received U.S. Food and Drug Administration orphan drug designation for patients with LPS and has already demonstrated antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of LPS and other solid tumors in Phase 1 clinical trial, potentially validating a rationally designed dosing schedule to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are your other plans with milademetan? Are you planning to explore its potential in other indications as well?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating milademetan in patients with LPS, we anticipate exploring several other MDM2-dependent tumors as a monotherapy, as well as a multitude of tumors with wild-type p53 in combination with other agents, leveraging the safety profile of milademetan. In the near term, we plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Share the details about DDLPS with our readers. Discuss its epidemiology and symptoms.</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>WD and DD LPS are two of the four subtypes comprising LPS, and together account for two-thirds of the overall LPS population.&nbsp; WD LPS is less aggressive and tends to be a large painless mass found in deeper tissues, however, DD LPS is more aggressive, arising from WD LPS, and is usually found in the tissue behind the abdominal area or the extremities. Both WD and DD LPS exhibit amplification of the MDM2 gene with nearly a 100% frequency, and hence are rational opportunities for treatment with MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The incidence of LPS is estimated at approximately 3,000 patients annually in the U.S. for which there are few effective treatment options with WD and DD LPS comprising about two-thirds of the total LPS population.<sup>1</sup> While the symptoms of LPS depend on where the tumor is located, patients may at first notice a new or growing lump that may be painful.<sup>2</sup></em><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you feel competition in this space? If yes, who are they and how will milademetan create a difference with others?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We believe we are leaders within the space given an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal study in DD LPS with an efficacy and safety profile from prior clinical studies that differentiate us from others.&nbsp; We believe milademetan could be the best-in-class MDM2 inhibitor. We intend to leverage the unique therapeutic window differences of milademetan versus the other programs by embarking on a broad and extensive clinical development program.&nbsp; We believe additional clinical studies will help to highlight the potential of milademetan across various MDM2-dependent and wildtype TP53 tumors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What makes you work on precision medicine for patients suffering from cancer?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The recent advancements in cancer research and drug development allow for an unprecedented degree of insight into the critical drivers of cancer growth and its associated signaling networks and vulnerabilities. Our vision is to help cancer patients live life to the fullest. To make this a reality, we have assembled a relentless team who is unshaken by obstacles, fiercely aware that someone needs us now, and is committed to harnessing tumor biology to develop vanguard therapies to treat patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Overall, the Rain strategy is aimed at giving patients and their families their lives back. Finding new targeted treatment options for these patients is the essence of our work and patients are our inspiration. Patients guide our development of new treatment options that have the potential to be not only more effective but also preserve the quality of life. It is our ultimate goal to provide patients with effective treatment options that are not characterized by the unwanted side effects that are so common with most cancer treatments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaborations to offer precision therapies to more patients?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We are always open to new collaborations to advance our precision oncology pipeline with partners that share our mission of developing and implementing innovative precision medicine strategies for patients suffering from cancer, and their families.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the companyâ€™s near-term plans? Share your achievements with our readers.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the recent initiation of our Phase 3 MANTRA clinical trial, we recently provided an update from the Phase 1 dose-escalation</em> and expansion study evaluating milademetan across four-dose<em> schedules in patients with LPS, solid tumors or lymphomas.&nbsp;As of July 1, 2021, three WD/DD LPS patients received therapy with milademetan monotherapy for greater than 51 months. Further, we completed an initial public offering for Rain in April of this year that enables meaningful capital support to generate data for milademetan across a variety of MDM2-dependent tumor indications. We also plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We look forward to collaborating with several partners and hope to present results from our ongoing research for milademetan and the RAD52 program at upcoming conferences.</em></p>

NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for COMIRNATY<sup>®</sup> (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. COMIRNATY is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be granted approval by the FDA.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005499/en/</p>
The vaccine has been available in the U.S. under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) since December 11, 2020 (as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The EUA permitted essential rollout of vaccine doses across the U.S. to help provide protection during the COVID-19 public health emergency, based on initial data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.

For FDA approval, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted a comprehensive data package that included longer-term follow-up data from the Phase 3 trial, where the vaccine’s high efficacy and favorable safety profile were observed up to six months after the second dose. The BLA submission package also included the manufacturing and facilities data required for licensure. Pfizer and BioNTech completed submission of the BLA in May 2021, and the BLA was granted Priority Review in July 2021.

“Based on the longer-term follow-up data that we submitted, today’s decision by the FDA affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed. About 60 percent of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated, and infection, hospitalization and death rates continue to rise rapidly among unvaccinated populations across the country,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “I am hopeful this approval will help increase confidence in our vaccine, as vaccination remains the best tool we have to help protect lives and achieve herd immunity. Hundreds of millions of doses of our vaccine already have been administered in the U.S. since December 2020, and we look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. government to reach more Americans now that we have FDA approval.”

“Today's full approval by the FDA underlines the vaccine's high efficacy and favorable safety profile,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “Our companies have shipped more than one billion doses worldwide, and we will continue to work tirelessly to broaden the access to our vaccine and to be prepared for potential emerging escape variants.”

<b>Pfizer Disclosure Notice</b>

The information contained in this release is as of August 23, 2021. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments.

This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizer’s efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program and COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) (BNT162b2) (including the approval of the BLA for BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older in the U.S., a potential submission of a supplemental BLA for a potential booster dose of BNT162b2 in individuals 16 years of age and older, a potential supplemental BLA to support potential full FDA approval of BNT162b2 in individuals 12 through 15 years, qualitative assessments of available data, potential benefits, expectations for clinical trials, the anticipated timing of regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals or authorizations and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply) involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including the Phase 3 data), including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when the potential supplemental BLAs will be filed in any jurisdictions and whether and when other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorization or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including the potential supplemental BLAs or any requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations) or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine’s ultra-low temperature formulation, two-dose schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or new variant-specific vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated; whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer’s business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.

DUBLIN and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 23, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (""Theravance Biopharma"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: TBPH), a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of organ-selective medicines, today announced top-line results from its Phase 2b dose-finding induction study of izencitinib, an orally administered, gut-selective pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
<div id=""DivAssetPlaceHolder1"" class=""PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference"">

&nbsp;

</div>
The study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in the total Mayo score or the key secondary endpoint of clinical remission at week 8, relative to placebo. There was a small dose-dependent increase in clinical response measured by the adapted Mayo score, which was driven by a reduction in rectal bleeding.

At all doses, izencitinib was well-tolerated when administered orally once daily for 8 weeks; adverse event rates were similar among patients receiving izencitinib and placebo. There were no instances of perforation, opportunistic infection, major cardiovascular or thromboembolic event, complicated zoster, or non-melanoma skin cancer in patients receiving izencitinib. There were no notable changes in lab values including creatine phosphokinase and lipids in patients receiving izencitinib relative to placebo. Plasma exposure of izencitinib was low, consistent with expectations for a gut-selective medicine.

The Company plans to present study results at a scientific forum.

<i>""We had high expectations for the Phase 2b study after eight weeks of treatment with izencitinib in ulcerative colitis given the totality and consistency of the broad range of clinical, histologic, and biomarker data we saw in the Phase 1b study with only four weeks of treatment, albeit in a small number of patients. We plan to analyze the data to better understand the findings and the potential for optimization of a gut-selective medicine as a treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases,"" said Rick E Winningham, Chief Executive Officer, Theravance Biopharma. ""We are grateful to all those who participated in this clinical trial and to those who are still participating in the Crohn's Phase 2 study – which we expect to report top-line results in late fourth quarter 2021 or early first quarter 2022.""</i>

Regarding current plans, the Company will work to understand the complete results and implications for izencitinib. Forthcoming ulcerative colitis data will include results from the 16-week extended induction portion of the study and the 44-week maintenance study. The Company reiterates timing of the top-line results of the Crohn's Phase 2 study in late fourth quarter 2021 or early first quarter 2022. Based on the ulcerative colitis results, the Company will seek to minimize future expenses associated with the izencitinib program.

<b>About the Phase 2b Dose-Finding Induction Study</b>

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b dose-finding induction study (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3266983-1&amp;h=477648281&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03758443%3Fterm%3Dtd-1473%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D6&amp;a=NCT03758443"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03758443</a>) for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis with the primary endpoint at Week 8 (n=239). The safety and efficacy data of this Phase 2b study were intended to inform induction and maintenance dose regimens for a confirmatory Phase 3 induction study and the ongoing maintenance study.

<b>About Theravance Biopharma and Janssen Strategic Collaboration </b>

Theravance Biopharma and Janssen Biotech, Inc. have a global co-development and commercialization agreement for izencitinib, also known as TD-1473, and other compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Theravance Biopharma received an upfront payment of $100 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $900 million in potential payments, if Janssen elects to remain in the collaboration following the completion of certain Phase 2 activities. In that scenario, Theravance Biopharma and Janssen will jointly develop and commercialize izencitinib in inflammatory intestinal diseases, with the two companies sharing expenses related to a potential Phase 3 program and profits in the U.S.

<b>About Janus (JAK) Kinase Inhibition </b>

JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, myelofibrosis, and ulcerative colitis. However, these products are known to have adverse effects associated with their systemic exposure.

<b>About Izencitinib </b>

Izencitinib, also known as TD-1473, is an orally administered, once-daily, investigational, internally discovered, high affinity, reversible pan-JAK inhibitor which was designed to be gut selective. The gut-selective design provides izencitinib the potential to distribute throughout the gastrointestinal tract tissues and target inflammation at the site of gastrointestinal disease while limiting its systemic exposure. Theravance Biopharma is focused on utilizing izencitinib for the potential treatment of a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

<b>About Theravance Biopharma </b>

Theravance Biopharma, Inc. is a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines. Its purpose is to pioneer a new generation of small molecule drugs designed to better meet patient needs. Its research is focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology.

<strong>Basel, August 24, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced an update on the Phase III BELINDA study investigating Kymriah<sup>®</sup> (tisagenlecleucel) in aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) after relapse or lack of response to first-line treatment. The BELINDA study did not meet its primary endpoint of event-free survival compared to treatment with the standard-of-care (SOC). SOC was salvage chemotherapy followed in responding patients by high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The safety profile was consistent with the established safety profile of Kymriah. Novartis will complete a full evaluation of the BELINDA data and work with investigators on the future presentation of the results.

“Patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who are refractory to first-line treatment are vulnerable and we are disappointed that the BELINDA study did not meet its primary endpoint in this setting,” said Jeff Legos, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Oncology &amp; Hematology Development. “Kymriah continues to demonstrate durable responses for patients with certain advanced blood cancers in the third-line setting. We remain committed to accelerating development of Kymriah and our next-generation CAR-Ts and anticipate sharing early clinical results for these therapies at an upcoming medical meeting.”

“We were hopeful the BELINDA study would show that Kymriah could improve outcomes and the overall treatment experience for these patients in need. The study investigators will work together with Novartis in the coming weeks and months to understand the factors that contributed to this outcome,” said Michael R. Bishop, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program, University of Chicago Medicine and BELINDA Steering Committee Chair.

Novartis is grateful to the patients, families and investigators who participated in this trial for their determination to contribute to advancing the treatment of this aggressive blood cancer.

<strong>About the BELINDA study</strong>
The BELINDA study is a pivotal Phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter trial comparing two treatment strategies and assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) compared to standard-of-care (SOC). Patients in the trial had aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with primary refractory disease, or which relapsed within 12 months of first-line treatment. SOC was salvage chemotherapy followed in responding patients by high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

This international trial enrolled patients from over 73 sites in 18 countries worldwide. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or stable disease at or after the week 12 assessment, per blinded independent review committee (BIRC), or death at any time. Secondary endpoints include EFS as assessed by local investigator, overall survival, overall response rate, duration of response, time to response and safety. Patients in the control arm, receiving SOC, had the opportunity to cross over to receive Kymriah upon progression determined by BIRC.

<strong>About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell &amp; Gene</strong>
Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell &amp; gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of the Novartis commitment to CAR-T cell therapy.

Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult (up to and including 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Kymriah is available in 30 countries and 330 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion.

The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities, across four continents and includes both Novartis-owned and contract manufacturing sites. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the Novartis manufacturing and supply chain.

<strong>US FDA approved indication for Kymriah</strong>
Kymriah<sup>®</sup> (tisagenlecleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy, which is indicated for:

<strong>Kymriah</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information</strong>
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.

Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

<strong>Brussels, Belgium – 24th August 2021 – 07:00 CEST</strong> - UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for BIMZELX<sup>®</sup> (bimekizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>1</sup> Bimekizumab is the first approved treatment in the European Union (EU) for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that is designed to selectively and directly inhibit both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.<sup>1</sup>

Bimekizumab is approved at a recommended dose of 320 mg, administered by two subcutaneous injections every four weeks to week 16 and every eight weeks thereafter.<sup>1</sup> For some patients with a body weight ≥120 kg who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, 320 mg every 4 weeks after week 16 may further improve treatment response.<sup>1</sup>

“The approval of BIMZELX in Europe is the first marketing authorization for this new psoriasis treatment worldwide and represents a landmark moment for the dermatology community and UCB. Our ambition is to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases, and we are incredibly proud to bring a new treatment option to people living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in Europe. We believe that bimekizumab has the potential to raise expectations of what psoriasis treatment can deliver.” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President, Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

Psoriasis can have a considerable physical and psychological impact on patients, as well as being detrimental to their quality of life, potentially affecting work, recreation, relationships, family and social life.<sup>2</sup> A cross-sectional patient survey showed at least 90 percent of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis place a high value on treatment which provides clear skin, a sustained response and rapid onset of action.<sup>3</sup> In addition, a real-world study showed that gaining completely clear skin can make a meaningful difference to the impact psoriasis has on patients’ health-related quality of life.<sup>4</sup>

“In the pivotal Phase 3 studies patients treated with bimekizumab achieved superior levels of skin clearance compared to those treated with placebo, adalimumab and ustekinumab, and in the Phase 3b study, treatment with bimekizumab resulted in greater levels of skin clearance than secukinumab. Across studies, about 60 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved complete skin clearance at week 16, and this response was maintained for up to a year.” said Professor Richard Warren, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and The University of Manchester, UK. “The approval of bimekizumab in the EU provides a welcome new treatment option that may help more patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis to achieve their treatment goals.”

The European Commission approval follows a positive opinion granted in June 2021 by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The approval is supported by positive results from three Phase 3 studies, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in 1,480 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.<sup>1</sup> Full findings from the Phase 3 BE READY and BE VIVID studies are published in <em>The Lancet</em>, and the results of the Phase 3 BE SURE study are published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>.<sup>5,6,7</sup>

The approval from the European Commission is valid in all 27 member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Regulatory reviews are also underway in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.

<strong>Notes to Editors:</strong>

<strong>About the Phase 3 Psoriasis Clinical Development Program</strong>
The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab were evaluated in three Phase 3 studies, versus placebo and ustekinumab (BE VIVID), versus placebo (BE READY) and versus adalimumab (BE SURE).<sup>5,6,7</sup> All studies met their co-primary endpoints and all ranked secondary endpoints.<sup>5,6,7</sup>

Patients treated with bimekizumab achieved superior levels of skin clearance at week 16, compared to those who received ustekinumab (ranked secondary endpoint, BE VIVID; p&lt;0.0001), placebo (co-primary endpoint, BE READY and BE VIVID; p&lt;0.0001) and adalimumab (co-primary endpoint, BE SURE; p&lt;0.001), as measured by at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area &amp; Severity Index (PASI 90) and an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0/1).<sup>5,6,7</sup> Clinical responses achieved with bimekizumab at week 16 were maintained up to one year in all studies.<sup>5,6,7</sup> The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the clinical studies were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5 percent) (most frequently nasopharyngitis) and oral candidiasis (7.3 percent).<sup>1</sup> For additional information on the bimekizumab Phase 3 clinical trial program, in psoriasis, please refer to the peer-reviewed publications and visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.

<strong>About BIMZELX<sup>®</sup> (bimekizumab) in the EU</strong>
Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.<sup>1</sup> Elevated concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17F have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases including plaque psoriasis.<sup>1</sup> Bimekizumab inhibits these proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in the normalization of skin inflammation and as a consequence improvement in clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis.<sup>1 </sup>

<strong>Bimzelx<sup>®</sup> ▼ (bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information</strong>
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%) (most frequently nasopharyngitis) and oral candidiasis (7.3%). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) were oral candidiasis, tinea infections, ear infections, herpes simplex infections, oropharyngeal candidiasis, gastroenteritis, folliculitis, headache, dermatitis and eczema, acne, injection site reactions, fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis, dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.

*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area

Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).

Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be administered in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB and patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.

Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.

<strong>Forward looking statements UCB </strong>
This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, Aug. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced the European Commission (EC) approved RINVOQ<sup>®</sup> (upadacitinib), an oral, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>1</sup> The recommended dose of RINVOQ for atopic dermatitis in adults is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual patient presentation, and 15 mg once daily for adolescents (12-17 years of age) and adults 65 years and older.<sup>1</sup> RINVOQ can be used with or without topical corticosteroids (TCS).<sup class=""last-child"">1
</sup>

""This is a significant milestone for AbbVie in our pursuit to transform care in atopic dermatitis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Michael Severino</span>, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. ""We are excited to provide an additional treatment option in Europe to help alleviate the burden of unrelenting itch and rash that many of these patients struggle with in daily life, despite available treatment options.""

The EC approval is supported by data from one of the largest registrational Phase 3 programs in atopic dermatitis with more than 2,500 adults and adolescents with moderate to severe disease.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> These studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ monotherapy (Measure Up 1 [MU1] and Measure Up 2 [MU2]) and with topical corticosteroids (AD Up [AU]) compared to placebo.<sup>1</sup> In all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16.<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

""As a dermatologist researching and treating atopic dermatitis for more than 25 years, I've seen first-hand the debilitating impact this disease can have on a person's daily life,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child"">Alan Irvine</span>, M.D., D.Sc., professor of dermatology, <span class=""xn-org last-child"">Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</span>, and RINVOQ clinical study investigator. ""Clinicians need more tools to help them treat and manage this complex disease. The degree and early onset of skin clearance and itch relief in the RINVOQ Phase 3 clinical studies are very encouraging. The outcomes have the potential to advance treatment goals for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.""

<b class=""first-child"">Highlights From the Global Phase 3 Atopic Dermatitis Clinical Trial Program<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup></b><br class=""last-child"" />Across the Phase 3 studies, all primary and secondary endpoints were met with 15 mg and 30 mg doses of RINVOQ compared to placebo. Highlights include:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">Significantly more patients achieved EASI 75 at week 16 in the RINVOQ 15 mg group (MU1: 70%; MU2: 60%; AU: 65%) and the RINVOQ 30 mg group (MU1: 80%; MU2: 73%; AU: 77%), compared to placebo (MU1: 16%; MU2: 13%; AU: 26%).</li>
 	<li>Significantly more patients achieved vIGA-AD 0/1 at week 16 in the RINVOQ 15 mg group (MU1: 48%; MU2: 39%; 40: 31%) and the RINVOQ 30 mg group (MU1: 62%; MU2: 52%; AU: 59%) compared to placebo (MU1: 8%; MU2: 5%; AU: 11%).</li>
 	<li>Significantly more patients achieved clinically meaningful itch reduction (improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS ≥4) in the RINVOQ 15 mg group (MU1: 52%; MU2: 42%; AU: 52%) and the RINVOQ 30 mg group (MU1: 60%; MU2: 60%; AU: 64%) compared to placebo (MU1: 12%; MU2: 9%; AU: 15%) at week 16.</li>
 	<li>Clinically meaningful itch reduction (improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS ≥4) and skin clearance (EASI 75) were observed as early as week 1 and week 2, respectively, in patients treated with either dose of RINVOQ compared to those treated with placebo.</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">Results at week 16 continued to be maintained through week 52 in patients treated with either dose of RINVOQ.</li>
</ul>
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5% of patients) with RINVOQ 15 mg or 30 mg were upper respiratory tract infection (25.4%), acne (15.1%), herpes simplex (8.4%), headache (6.3%) and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK; 5.5%).<sup class=""first-child"">1 </sup>The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections (&lt;1.0%).<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">About RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup> (upadacitinib)</b><b> </b>
Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup>1,10-20</sup> In human cellular assays, RINVOQ preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.<sup>1</sup> RINVOQ 15 mg is also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, and by the European Commission for adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">12-20</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Important EU Indications and Safety Information about RINVOQ<sup class=""first-child"">®</sup> (upadacitinib)<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup></b>

Rheumatoid arthritis<br class=""first-child last-child"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Psoriatic arthritis<br class=""first-child last-child"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs. RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.

Ankylosing spondylitis<br class=""first-child last-child"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

Atopic dermatitis<br class=""first-child last-child"" />RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

<b class=""first-child"">Contraindications</b><br class=""last-child"" />RINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and during pregnancy.

<b class=""first-child"">Special warnings and precautions for use</b>
<i>Immunosuppressive medicinal products</i><br class=""last-child"" />Use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.

<i class=""first-child"">Serious infections</i><br class=""last-child"" />Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients ≥65 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.

<i class=""first-child"">Viral reactivation</i><br class=""last-child"" />Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, was reported in clinical studies. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in Japanese patients treated with upadacitinib.

<i class=""first-child"">Vaccinations</i><br class=""last-child"" />The use of live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.

<i class=""first-child"">Malignancy</i><br class=""last-child"" />The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Malignancies, including nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy.

<i class=""first-child"">Hematological abnormalities</i><br class=""last-child"" />Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with hematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.

<i class=""first-child"">Cardiovascular risk</i><br class=""last-child"" />RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

<i class=""first-child"">Lipids</i><br class=""last-child"" />Upadacitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

<i class=""first-child"">Hepatic transaminase elevations</i><br class=""last-child"" />Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo.

<i class=""first-child"">Venous thromboembolisms</i><br class=""last-child"" />Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE.

<b class=""first-child"">Adverse reactions</b><br class=""last-child"" />The most commonly reported adverse reactions in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis clinical trials (≥2% of patients in at least one of the indications) with upadacitinib 15 mg were upper respiratory tract infections, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, alanine transaminase increased, bronchitis, nausea, cough, aspartate transaminase increased, and hypercholesterolemia.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis trials (≥2% of patients) with upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg were upper respiratory tract infection, acne, herpes simplex, headache, CPK increased, cough, folliculitis, abdominal pain, nausea, neutropenia, pyrexia, and influenza.

Ankylosing spondylitis:<br class=""first-child last-child"" />Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with RA.

Psoriatic arthritis:<br class=""first-child last-child"" />Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with RA. A higher incidence of acne and bronchitis was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg (1.3% and 3.9%, respectively) compared to placebo (0.3% and 2.7%, respectively). A higher rate of serious infections (2.6 events per 100 patient-years and 1.3 events per 100 patient-years, respectively) and hepatic transaminase elevations (ALT elevations Grade 3 and higher rates 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively) was observed in patients treated with upadacitinib in combination with MTX therapy compared to patients treated with monotherapy. There was a higher rate of serious infections in patients ≥65 years of age, although data are limited.

Atopic dermatitis:<br class=""first-child"" />Dose-dependent changes in ALT increased and/or AST increased (≥ 3 x ULN), lipid parameters, CPK values (&gt; 5 x ULN), and neutropenia <i>(</i>ANC &lt; 1 x 10<sup class=""last-child"">9</sup> cells/L) associated with upadacitinib treatment were similar to what was observed in the rheumatologic disease clinical studies. Based on limited data in atopic dermatitis patients aged 65 years and older, there was a higher rate of overall adverse reactions with the upadacitinib 30 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose. The safety profile for upadacitinib 15 mg in adolescents was similar to that in adults. The safety and efficacy of the 30 mg dose in adolescents are still being investigated.

<p class=""mod__txt--normal"">Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan; Representative Director, President, Gyo Sagara; “ONO”) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan; President and CEO, Christophe Weber; “Takeda”) today announced that the companies have received an approval for combination therapy of ONO’s Opdivo® (nivolumab) Intravenous Infusion (“Opdivo”), a human anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and Takeda’s CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib s-malate) tablets (“CABOMETYX”), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which Takeda has licensed from Exelixis, Inc. (“Exelixis”) for development and commercialization in Japan, in combination therapy for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval.</p>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal"">　This approval is based on results from the global, multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER study, evaluating Opdivo and CABOMETYX combination therapy versus sunitinib alone in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. In this study, Opdivo and CABOMETYX combination therapy demonstrated a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the blinded independent central review (BICR), compared to sunitinib alone at the final analysis, as well as the secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the BICR. The safety profiles of Opdivo and CABOMETYX combination therapy observed in the study were consistent with the previously reported safety profile of each product.</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About Checkmate -9ER Study</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal"">　CheckMate -9ER study is a global, multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study, evaluating Opdivo and CABOMETYX combination therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC, versus sunitinib alone. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the Opdivo and CABOMETYX combination therapy group receiving Opdivo 240 mg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks and CABOMETYX 40 mg orally once daily, or the control group receiving sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week non-treatment period until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as assessed by the BICR. The secondary endpoints were OS and ORR as assessed by the BICR.
Since August 2018, ONO and Takeda have participated in Japan in this global study which has been ongoing under the collaboration among Bristol Myers Squibb (New York, US), Exelixis and their other partner, Ipsen Pharma SAS (France).</p>

<h4 class=""mod__ttl-4 fz19"">About Opdivo</h4>
<p class=""mod__txt--normal"">　Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers since the approval for the treatment of melanoma in Japan in July 2014. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, the US and European Union.
In Japan, ONO launched Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable melanoma in September 2014. Thereafter, Opdivo received an approval for additional indications of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer in December 2015, unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in August 2016, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2016, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in March 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy in September 2017, unresectable advanced or recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma which has progressed after chemotherapy in August 2018, and microsatellite instability high (MSI-High) unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy and unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer that has progressed following chemotherapy in February 2020.
In addition, ONO has submitted supplemental applications for the adjuvant treatment of urothelial cancer and cancer of unknown primary, and is conducting clinical development program including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, etc.</p>

<p align=""justify"">“gMG is a severe, chronic and debilitating disease that can be unpredictable and greatly impact a person’s quality of life. The EMA’s validation is an exciting step closer to our goal of helping people globally who are living with this disease in which there remains a significant unmet need.” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “We have been building an experienced commercial team in Europe and look forward to our continued collaboration with European regulatory authorities through the review process.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“There remains a significant unmet need for new gMG treatment options that are targeted to the underlying pathogenesis of the disease and supported by clinical data,” commented Prof. Dr. Andreas Meisel, Senior Physician of Neurology, Head of Myasthenia Gravis Outpatient Clinic at the Department of Neurology, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Principal Investigator on the ADAPT study. “Myasthenia gravis can severely impact a person’s quality of life and ability to carry out daily tasks, such as speaking, chewing and swallowing food, or brushing teeth and hair. In some cases, patients may also experience difficulty breathing. I am hopeful for continued research advancements for new options to treat this debilitating disease.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Efgartigimod is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gMG with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 17, 2021. argenx also submitted and was notified of acceptance of an application for efgartigimod to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) earlier this year.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Phase 3 ADAPT Trial </strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America, Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and were treated. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT regardless of antibody status, including patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod or placebo for a total of 26 weeks. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by a variable number of subsequent treatment cycles. The primary endpoint was the number of AChR-Ab+ patients who achieved a response on the MG-ADL score defined by at least a two-point improvement for four or more consecutive weeks.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Efgartigimod </strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies, including neuromuscular disorders, blood disorders, and skin blistering diseases.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Myasthenia Gravis</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease, often causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. More than 85% of people with MG progress to generalized MG (gMG) within 18 months, where muscles throughout the body may be affected, resulting in extreme fatigue and difficulties with facial expression, speech, swallowing and mobility. In more life-threatening cases, MG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing.</p>

STAMFORD, Conn. and ST. GALLEN, Switzerland, Aug. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cara Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CARA) and Vifor Pharma today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KORSUVA™ (difelikefalin) for injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis . KORSUVA™ injection is a first-in-class kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist that targets the body’s peripheral nervous system. The KORSUVA™ injection new drug application (NDA) received Priority Review by the FDA, which is granted to therapies that, if approved, would offer significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications.

“The FDA approval of KORSUVA™ injection is a transformational milestone for Cara and a significant advancement for the substantial number of adult hemodialysis patients suffering from moderate-to-severe pruritus,” said Derek Chalmers, Ph.D., D.Sc., President and Chief Executive Officer of Cara Therapeutics. “We look forward to working closely with our commercial partner, Vifor Pharma, to launch KORSUVA™ injection in the U.S in the coming months. We extend our deepest gratitude to the patients who participated in our KALM-1 and KALM-2 clinical trials, the study investigators, and especially our employees, as their commitment through over 10 years of collective effort made this important milestone possible.”

“We are very excited about the FDA approval of KORSUVA™ injection,” said Abbas Hussain, Chief Executive Officer of Vifor Pharma “There is a significant unmet medical need for a targeted therapy, and we believe that KORSUVA™ injection can fundamentally change the treatment paradigm for adult CKD-aP patients undergoing dialysis. We are committed to bringing this first-in-class medicine to U.S. hemodialysis patients as fast as possible, together with our partner Cara Therapeutics.”

“We are pleased to see that KORSUVA™ injection has received FDA approval as the first treatment option approved for moderate to severe pruritus in adult CKD patients on hemodialysis”, commented Dr. Frank Maddux, Global Chief Medical Officer of Fresenius Medical Care, “Participating in the robust clinical trial program we have learned that KORSUVA™ injection represents an effective treatment option. We have seen substantial improvement in symptoms and meaningful relief for people suffering from severe and debilitating itch.”

This approval is based on the New Drug Application filing that was supported by positive data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials – KALM-1, conducted in the U.S. (New England Journal of Medicine 2020; 382:222-232), and the global KALM-2, as well as supportive data from an additional 32 clinical studies.KORSUVA™ injection was found to be generally well tolerated.

Vifor Pharma and Cara have agreed to an exclusive license to commercialize KORSUVA™ in the United States. That agreement features a Cara 60%, Vifor Pharma 40% profit-sharing arrangement in non-Fresenius Medical Care clinics in the U.S. Under a previous agreement, Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma and Cara Therapeutics have agreed to market KORSUVA™ injection to Fresenius Medical Care North America dialysis clinics in the U.S. under a Cara 50%, Vifor Pharma 50% profit-sharing arrangement.

Vifor Pharma and Cara Therapeutics are in the process of submitting the required documentation to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure timely reimbursement and patient access to KORSUVA™ injection. Vifor Pharma expects to begin promoting KORSUVA™ Injection in Q1 2022 with reimbursement expected in H1 2022, subject to CMS timelines.

<strong>About KORSUVA™ Injection</strong>
KORSUVA is a kappa opioid receptor agonist developed in Cara laboratories and indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD-aP) in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). KORSUVA Injection is not a federally controlled substance.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation was received from the FDA for KORSUVA Injection for the treatment of CKD-aP in HD patients and the New Drug Application was evaluated by the FDA with Priority Review.

<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>

<strong><u>Warnings and Precautions</u></strong>
Dizziness, Somnolence, Mental Status Changes, and Gait Disturbances: These adverse reactions, including falls, have occurred in patients taking KORSUVA and may subside with continued treatment. Concomitant use of centrally acting depressant medications, sedating antihistamines, and opioid analgesics may increase the likelihood of these adverse reactions and should be used with caution during treatment with KORSUVA.

Risk of Driving and Operating Machinery: Dizziness, somnolence, and mental status changes have occurred in patients taking KORSUVA. KORSUVA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car and operating machinery. Advise patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery until the effect of KORSUVA on their ability to do so is known.

<strong><u>Adverse Reactions</u></strong>
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and ≥1% higher than placebo) were diarrhea (9.0%), dizziness (6.8%), nausea (6.6%), gait disturbances, including falls (6.6%), hyperkalemia (4.7%), headache (4.5%), somnolence (4.2%), and mental status changes (3.3%).

<strong><u>Use in Specific Populations</u></strong>
Severe Hepatic Impairment: The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of KORSUVA in subjects undergoing hemodialysis (HD) has not been evaluated; therefore, use of KORSUVA in this population is not recommended.
Geriatric Use: The incidence of somnolence was higher in KORSUVA-treated subjects aged 65 years and older (7.0%) than in KORSUVA-treated subjects less than 65 years of age (2.8%). The incidence was comparable in both placebo age groups (3.0% and 2.1%, respectively).

<strong><u>Indication</u></strong>
KORSUVA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD-aP) in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD).

Limitation of Use: KORSUVA has not been studied in patients on peritoneal dialysis and is not recommended for use in this population.

<strong>About Chronic Kidney Disease-associated Pruritus</strong>
CKD-aP is an intractable systemic itch condition that occurs with high frequency and intensity in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis. Pruritus has also been reported in patients with stage III-V CKD who are not on dialysis. Aggregate, longitudinal, multi-country studies estimate the weighted prevalence of CKD-aP to be approximately 40% in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with approximately 25% of patients reporting severe pruritus. The majority of dialysis patients (approximately 60 to 70%) report pruritus, with 30 to 40% reporting moderate or severe pruritus.<sup>1,2,3</sup> Recent data from the ITCH National Registry Study showed that among those with pruritus, approximately 59% experienced symptoms daily or nearly daily for more than a year. Given its association with CKD/ESRD, most afflicted patients will continue to have symptoms for months or years, with currently employed antipruritic treatments, such as antihistamines and corticosteroids, unable to provide consistent, adequate relief. Moderate-to-severe chronic pruritus has repeatedly been shown to directly decrease quality of life, contribute to symptoms that impair quality of life (such as poor sleep quality), and is associated with depression.<sup>4</sup> CKD-aP is also an independent predictor of mortality among hemodialysis patients, mainly related to increased risk of inflammation and infections.
