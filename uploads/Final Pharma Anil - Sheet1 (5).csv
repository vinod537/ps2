50727,AstraZeneca's Tagrisso (osimertinib) Receives the US FDA's Priority Review for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer,Tagrisso granted Priority Review in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer,"AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso has received sNDA’s acceptance and has been granted PR in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II, and IIIA) EGFRm NSCLC after complete tumor resection with curative intent
 The sNDA is based on the P-III ADAURA trial assessing Tagrisso (80mg, qd, PO) vs PBO for 3yrs. or until disease recurrence in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection & adjuvant CT as indicated. Unprecedented results showed reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 80% and improvement in DFS
 Tagrisso is an irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases with its expected PDUFA date in Q1’21","AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso (osimertinib) has received acceptance for its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and has also been granted Priority Review in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumour resection with curative intent.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is still common in early-stage disease and nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, experience recurrence within five years.1-4

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant improvements over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the first quarter of 2021.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer are still at considerable risk of recurrence after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and new targeted treatment options are critical to improving outcomes for these patients. This expedited review underscores the unprecedented disease-free survival benefit Tagrisso brings to patients in the adjuvant setting, and we will continue working with the FDA to provide this practice-changing treatment to patients as quickly as possible.”

The sNDA was based on results from the ADAURA Phase III trial showing Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the primary analysis population of patients with Stage II and IIIA EGFRm NSCLC, and also in the overall trial population of patients with Stage IB-IIIA disease, a key secondary endpoint.

In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the trial to be unblinded two years early, based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy. Investigators and patients continue to participate in the trial and remain blinded to treatment. The results from the ADAURA trial were presented during the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program in May 2020 and were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Tagrisso received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in this setting in July 2020. Tagrisso is approved for both the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.5 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.6 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3

For those with resectable tumours, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.4 Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.7-8

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.9-11 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signalling pathways that drive the growth of tumour cells.12

ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomised, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with Tagrisso 80mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled in more than 200 centres across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess overall survival.

Tagrisso

Tagrisso (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against central nervous system metastases. Tagrisso 40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC.

50765,Lilly's Taltz (ixekizumab) Receives Health Canada Approval for Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,Health Canada has approved TALTZ® (ixekizumab) for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA),"The approval is based on P-lll COAST-X study assessing Taltz (80mg, q4w) vs PBO for the treatment of adult patients with nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation for 52wks.
 Result: 1EPs of ASAS40 @16wks. (35% vs 19%); ASAS40 response @52wks. (30% vs 13%), met its 2EPs, showing efficacy in reducing disease activity and sacroiliac joint inflammation, improving patient function & QoL, the safety profile is consistent with the previous study
 Taltz is a mAb that selectively binds with IL-17A cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor","TORONTO, Oct. 19, 2020 /CNW/ – On October 14, 2020, Health Canada approved TALTZ® for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation who have responded inadequately to, or are intolerant to conventional therapy.1  Another first-in-class milestone for the treatment, this approval makes TALTZ the first IL-17A inhibitor to be approved by Health Canada for nr-axSpA. This is the fourth indication for TALTZ, which was first approved by Health Canada for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in 2016, psoriatic arthritis in 2018, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in 2020.

“People living with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis suffer through considerable pain and other symptoms of inflammation for as long as ten years before being accurately diagnosed. Limited treatment options exacerbate this challenge. Health Canada’s approval of TALTZ for this indication offers potential relief to many Canadians living with this debilitating condition,” says Dr. Doron Sagman, vice president, R&D and Medical Affairs, Eli Lilly Canada.

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), which includes both AS and nr-axSpA, is a disease that predominantly affects the sacroiliac joints and the spine, which results in chronic inflammatory back pain and fatigue.2,3,4  For patients with AS, the disease is characterized by the presence of structural damage of the sacroiliac joints that appears on an X-ray, while patients with nr-axSpA do not have structural damage that is clearly detectable radiographically.6 These two patient subsets share a similar burden of disease and similar clinical features. However, approved biologic treatment options for patients with nr-axSpA are much more limited and patients are often underdiagnosed.4,5 Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis symptoms often first strike in late adolescence or early adulthood, often before the age of 40.7

This approval is based on the results from the Phase 3 COAST-X trial, which evaluated improvement in signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response criteria compared to placebo. The ASAS40 response measures the improvement in signs and symptoms of the disease, such as pain, inflammation and function.

“In the COAST-X study, 35% of patients treated with TALTZ met the ASAS40 primary endpoint at Week 16 compared to 19% treated with placebo. In addition, more than twice as many people achieved ASAS40 when treated with TALTZ vs. placebo by week 52,” says Dr. Proton Rahman, MD, FRCPC, Rheumatologist, St. John’s, NL and COAST-X trial investigator. “These figures reiterate that TALTZ could be an effective treatment option for adults living with axial spondyloarthritis.”

In COAST-X, the safety and efficacy of TALTZ was demonstrated in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study of adult patients with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving ASAS40 at Week 16 (Canada, EU) and Week 52 (US). The proportion of TALTZ patients (n=96) achieving the primary endpoint of ASAS40 at Week 16 was superior to placebo (n=105), with 35% of patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every four weeks achieving ASAS40 response compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo (p<0.05). A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with TALTZ achieved an ASAS40 response as early as Week 1 compared with placebo. The ASAS40 response at Week 52 was achieved by 30% of TALTZ patients, compared to 13% of placebo patients who achieved the same endpoint (p<0.01). The safety profile of TALTZ in patients with nr-axSpA was consistent with previous experience with TALTZ in other approved indications.

“We are pleased to learn that a new medication to treat non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis has been approved by Health Canada,” says Graeme Reed, Chair, Canadian Spondylitis Association. “Timely and equitable access to diverse and affordable treatment options are essential for patients living with this painful and debilitating condition.”

Other major secondary endpoints of the study included change from baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (BASDAI), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score, the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (ASDAS <2.1), and change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) score in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints. The major secondary endpoints were met, with TALTZ showing efficacy in reducing disease activity and sacroiliac joint inflammation, and in improving patient function and quality of life.

About TALTZ®
TALTZ® (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. TALTZ inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

About the COAST-X Study
COAST-X was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TALTZ for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients were required to have an established diagnosis of nr-axSpA and active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score ≥4 and a total back pain score ≥4 on a 0-10 scale at screening and baseline, and were required to have objective signs of inflammation by presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or presence of elevated CRP >5 mg/L.

About the TALTZ Program in axSpA
The COAST-X study is part of a clinical development program that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TALTZ across various population subsets of patients with axSpA. The COAST program includes three registration studies, each of one year in duration: COAST-V in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/radiographic axSpA who are biologic-naive; COAST-W in patients with AS/radiographic axSpA who previously had an inadequate response or were intolerant to 1 or 2 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; and COAST-X in biologic-naive nr-axSpA patients with objective signs of inflammation. Patients could enroll into a long-term extension study (COAST-Y) after completing of any of these registration studies to receive TALTZ treatment for up to an additional two years.

 Prasinezumab is the first anti-alpha synuclein Ab to advance into late-stage development. Additionally, Prothena will earn a $60M clinical milestones upon the first patient dosed in the study","DUBLIN, Ireland, Oct. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Prothena Corporation plc (NASDAQ:PRTA), a late-stage clinical company with expertise in protein dysregulation and a diverse pipeline of investigational therapeutics for neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases, today announced that based on positive signals of efficacy consistent with disease modification in the PASADENA study, Roche and Prothena plan to advance prasinezumab into a Phase 2b study in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. The study will be designed to further assess the efficacy of prasinezumab by expanding upon the patient population enrolled in PASADENA to include patients with early Parkinson’s disease on stable levodopa therapy. Prasinezumab is the first anti-alpha synuclein antibody to advance into late-stage development. Prothena will earn a $60 million clinical milestone payment upon first patient dosed in this study. Further details are expected to be announced in the first half of 2021.

“We are very encouraged by the results from PASADENA, demonstrating significant slowing of motor progression and improvements on imaging biomarkers consistent with disease modification, as this provides a rich dataset to directly inform and de-risk this next late-stage study,” stated Gene Kinney, PhD, president and chief executive officer of Prothena. “Results from the PASADENA study are part of a growing clinical body of evidence suggesting antibodies that optimally target misfolded proteins can result in clinically meaningful benefit. With a growing pipeline of programs based on this scientific approach, Prothena is poised to advance a number of novel therapeutics for devastating diseases.”

About Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the entire nervous system that affects one in 100 people over age 60. An estimated seven to 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s disease worldwide. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. The disease is characterized by the neuronal accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein in the CNS and peripheral nervous system that results in a wide spectrum of worsening progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. While diagnosis relies on motor symptoms classically associated with Parkinson’s disease, non-motor symptoms may present many years earlier. Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are symptomatic and only address a subset of symptoms such as motor impairment, dementia, or psychosis. There are currently no treatments available that target the underlying cause of the disease and can slow its progression.

About Alpha-synuclein

Alpha-synuclein, a protein found in neurons and other cells, is a major component of pathology that characterizes several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which collectively are termed synucleinopathies. The understanding of the normal physiological function of alpha-synuclein is limited, but evidence indicates that soluble forms of the protein may interact with other proteins and certain intracellular membranes. In synucleinopathies, the alpha-synuclein protein appears to be abnormally aggregated intracellularly, which contributes to disease pathology. There is increasing evidence that certain aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein can be transmitted from neuron to neuron, resulting in a propagation of pathology that causes neuronal dysfunction and loss. Recent studies in cellular and animal models of synucleinopathy suggest that the spread of alpha-synuclein-associated neuronal pathology can be disrupted by targeting aberrant forms of alpha-synuclein.

About Prasinezumab

Prasinezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets alpha-synuclein, a protein found in neurons that can aggregate and spread from cell to cell, resulting in the neuronal dysfunction and loss that causes Parkinson’s disease. Prasinezumab is designed to block the cell-to-cell transmission of the aggregated, pathogenic forms of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, thereby slowing clinical decline. Prior to initiating clinical trials, the efficacy of prasinezumab was evaluated in various cellular and animal models of alpha-synuclein-related disease. In alpha-synuclein transgenic mice, the murine version of prasinezumab reduced the appearance of alpha-synuclein pathology, protected synapses and halted the worsening of behavioral phenotypes. In December 2013, Prothena and Roche entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize antibodies that target alpha-synuclein, including prasinezumab. Prothena has an option to co-promote prasinezumab in the U.S., where the companies share all development and commercialization costs, as well as profits, on a 30/70 basis (30 percent Prothena, 70 percent Roche). Outside the U.S., Roche has sole responsibility for developing and commercializing prasinezumab and has agreed to pay Prothena up to double-digit royalties on net sales. To date, Prothena has earned $75 million of a total potential $600 million in milestone payments that includes clinical, regulatory and sales milestones.

50796,"Jazz Reports Results of Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) in P-III Study for Cataplexy or EDS in Patients with Narcolepsy","Jazz Pharmaceuticals Announces SLEEP Publication of Phase 3 Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) Oral Solution Study in Cataplexy or Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Narcolepsy","The P-III study involves assessing Xywav vs PBO in patients aged ≥ 7yrs. with cataplexy or EDS with narcolepsy
 Results: study met its 1EPs & 2EPs i.e. differences in median change in a weekly number of cataplexy attacks and ESS scores. Results were published at World Sleep 2019
 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium or ~1,000- 1,500 mg/night less than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6-9gms. The company expects to launch in Q4’20, following RESM implementation","DUBLIN, Oct. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced the publication of the global Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study of Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium oxybates) oral solution, for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy. The results were published in SLEEP, the peer-reviewed, international journal of the Sleep Research Society.

In the trial, Xywav achieved the primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating highly statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) in median change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores compared to placebo. Results of the study were previously presented in an oral presentation at World Sleep 2019.1

“This publication reinforces the option Xywav provides for those living with cataplexy or EDS associated with narcolepsy,” said Robert Iannone, M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “Xywav was approved in July by the FDA as a new treatment option indicated for both cataplexy and EDS in people living with narcolepsy and I am proud to be part of the organization that developed this groundbreaking therapy for people living with this debilitating neurological disorder.”

This Phase 3 study served as the basis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.1,2 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium – or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night less – than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams.2 Meaningfully lowering the level of sodium ingested by patients taking oxybate therapy may help patients align with American Heart Association recommended levels of daily sodium intake.3

The study enrolled 201 participants and randomized 134 participants, which included those previously treated with sodium oxybate and naïve to sodium oxybate, with or without other anticataplectic treatments. During the two week double-blind randomized withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median weekly number of cataplexy attacks in participants randomized to take placebo compared with participants randomized to continue Xywav treatment (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.35 [0.00, 11.61] vs 0.00 [−0.49, 1.75], respectively; treatment difference, P<0.0001).1

At the end of the double-blind randomized-withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median ESS scores in participants randomized to take placebo compared with participants randomized to continue Xywav (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.0 [0.0, 5.0] vs 0.0 [−1.0, 1.0], respectively; treatment difference, P<0.0001).1 The most common adverse reactions reported by participants (≥5%) were headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia, diarrhea, hyperhidrosis, anxiety and vomiting.2

The company plans to launch Xywav in the fourth quarter of this year, following Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) implementation. Jazz is committed to ensuring access to our medicines and will work to secure the broadest access possible for appropriate patients.

About Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution
Xywav (JZP-258) oral solution, 0.5 g/mL total salts (equivalent to 0.413 g/mL of oxybate), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. It is also being studied and developed for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adult patients. Xywav is comprised of a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium, or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night less, than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams. Xywav has the same oxybate concentration as sodium oxybate and includes a mix of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium cations. While the exact mechanism of action of Xywav is unknown, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of Xywav on cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness are mediated through GABAB actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.2

Important Safety Information

WARNING: Taking XYWAV with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as medicines used to make you or your child fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in alertness (drowsiness), fainting (syncope), and death.

The active ingredient of XYWAV is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone or with other drugs that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has caused serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma, and death. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has any of these serious side effects.

Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYWAV and XYREM REMS Program to have your or your child’s prescription for XYWAV filled.

Do not take XYWAV if you take or your child takes other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that cause sleepiness), drinks alcohol, or has a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

Keep XYWAV in a safe place to prevent abuse and misuse. Selling or giving away XYWAV may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.

Anyone who takes XYWAV should not do anything that requires them to be fully awake or is dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery, or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Those activities should not be done until you know how XYWAV affects you or your child.

XYWAV can cause serious side effects, including the following:

Breathing problems, including slower breathing, trouble breathing, and/or short periods of not breathing while sleeping (sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they use XYWAV.
Mental health problems, including confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or upset, depression, thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself, increased tiredness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating.

About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.4,5,6 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood or adolescence.7,8,9 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.10,11 There are five main symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.12 While all people with narcolepsy experience EDS, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.5,11 EDS is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.9,13 EDS is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.7,9,10 Narcolepsy is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.14,15,16,17

About Cataplexy
Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (<2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.7,9 Although many emotions can potentially trigger cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.9 Cataplexy occurs in about 70 percent of people with narcolepsy.18 Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.7,9 Complete collapse is less common.7,9 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).7,9,18,19

50813,AWS and Onica Collaborate with Teva to Support its Digihaler Portfolio,"Teva, Amazon Web Services and Onica Announce Collaboration to Support Teva’s Digihaler® Portfolio","The three companies collaborated to build & host Teva’s Digital Health Platform which is a cloud-based backend data system, supporting the company’s FDA-approved Digihaler portfolio that consists of built-in sensors and Bluetooth wireless technology which connects to a mobile app that tracks inhaler events and measures inspiratory flow when a patient inhales
 Onica supported the serverless build of Teva’s platform and allow the system to deploy cloud capabilities of AWS. The digital health platform on AWS will allow for extreme scalability, resiliency, and cost-effectiveness
 The cloud system allows user to view stored information on their Digihaler events via the companion mobile app, which can be linked to multiple inhaler devices","TEL AVIV, Israel & PARSIPPANY, N.J. & SAN ANTONIO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Teva Respiratory, LLC, an affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) announced today that the company is collaborating with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and Onica, a Rackspace Technology company, to build and host its Digital Health Platform.

Teva’s Digital Health Platform is a cloud-based backend data system that currently supports the company’s FDA-approved Digihaler® portfolio, the first-ever family of breath-actuated digital inhalers that contain built-in sensors and Bluetooth® Wireless Technology, which connects to a companion mobile app that tracks inhaler events and measures inspiratory flow when a patient inhales.

Technology, like the Digihaler® family of inhalers, provides objective inhaler event data which may help foster patient and healthcare provider (HCP) dialogue and help inform treatment decisions. The Digihaler® device automatically detects, records and stores inhaler event data and measures inspiratory flow rates.

“Onica leads some of the most complex technology projects in the world,” said Tolga Tarhan, CTO, Rackspace Technology. “We are positioned at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Through our partnership with Teva, we stand to revolutionize the way patients access their data. Accessibility and security are at the forefront of our services and we are proud to be working on Teva’s Digital Health Platform.”

Onica’s development team supported the serverless build of Teva’s Digital Health Platform, allowing the system to fully leverage the best-in-breed cloud capabilities of AWS. Hosting Teva’s Digital Health Platform on AWS will allow for extreme scalability, resiliency and cost-effectiveness.

“We’re pleased to bring together AWS’s unmatched portfolio of services with Teva’s long-standing respiratory reputation and expertise to now provide objective inhaler use data which may help inform physicians in the care and treatment of patients,” said Shez Partovi, MD, Director of Worldwide Business Development for Healthcare, Life Sciences, and Genomics at AWS. “Teva’s approach to providing patients with access to and control of sharing their inhaler event data with their healthcare provider has the potential to impact and inform how patient care is delivered, and specifically, within the asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease states.”

With this cloud system in place, users will be able to view stored information on their Digihaler® events via the companion mobile app, which can be linked to multiple inhaler devices. Patients can review their data over time, receive event notifications, including if their inhalation technique may need improvement. If desired, this information can be shared with their healthcare providers to have more informed discussions about their condition and treatment.

“With our Digihaler® products now being commercially available to patients, ensuring data security is paramount,” said Sven Dethlefs, Executive Vice President, Global Marketing & Portfolio at Teva Pharmaceuticals. “With digital health and remote monitoring emerging as vital elements of patient care, we are excited to be working with AWS and Onica who are experienced in ensuring patients’ information is secure while easily accessible to them.”

The Digihaler® portfolio currently includes ProAir® Digihaler® (albuterol sulfate 117 mcg) Inhalation Powder, which is indicated for use in patients 4 years of age and older to treat or prevent bronchospasm in those who have reversible obstructive airway disease and to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm, in addition to AirDuo® Digihaler® (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) Inhalation Powder and ArmonAir® Digihaler® (fluticasone propionate) Inhalation Powder, both indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

50826,Novartis's Branaplam (LMI070) Receives the US FDA's Orphan Drug Designation for Huntington's Disease,Novartis receives US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Orphan Drug Designation for branaplam (LMI070) in Huntington’s disease (HD),"The US FDA has granted ODD for branaplam in HD. In preclinical trials, branaplam demonstrated a reduction in levels of the mutant huntingtin protein. Additionally, the therapy showed a reduction in huntingtin mRNA in SMA patients
 Novartis expects to initiate the P-IIb study for branaplam in HD patients in 2021
 Branaplam (qw, PO) is an RNA splicing modulator, currently under investigation for the treatment of SMA","Basel, October 21, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for branaplam (LMI070) in Huntington’s disease (HD). An Orphan Drug Designation grants special status to a drug that treats a rare disease or condition, and provides companies certain benefits to encourage the continued development of medicines that bring novel solutions to patients with these severe diseases.

In preclinical models, branaplam has been shown to reduce levels of mutant huntingtin protein. In addition, during the investigation of branaplam in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), it was also observed to reduce huntingtin messenger RNA (mRNA) in SMA patients. A decrease of huntingtin mRNA is expected to result in reduction of huntingtin protein levels, the underlying cause of HD. Based on these findings, Novartis intends to start a development program for branaplam to determine if it has the potential to be a transformative treatment for people living with this devastating condition.

Current treatment options for HD are limited to symptomatic treatments and there are no approved disease modifying therapies that delay disease onset or slow progression of the disease.

Branaplam is currently under investigation for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disease, characterized by loss of motor neurons that are responsible for muscle function. Branaplam is dosed once weekly for the treatment of SMA, and the same dosing regimen may also be a possibility for HD.

Novartis plans to start the Phase IIb trial for branaplam in HD patients in 2021.

About branaplam
Branaplam (LMI070) is a once-weekly, orally administered, small molecule RNA splicing modulator that is currently under investigation for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disease, characterized by loss of motor neurons that are responsible for muscle function. Novartis has more than 5 years’ clinical experience with branaplam in our ongoing SMA development program.

About Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive disability and death. Everyone has the huntingtin (HTT) gene, but only those who have a mutated form of the gene will develop the disease.

HD is characterized by progressive worsening in motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50, and worsen over a 15-20-year period. Approximately 70,000 people across Europe and the US have been clinically diagnosed with HD.

Current treatment options for HD are limited to symptomatic treatments and there are no approved disease modifying therapies that delay disease onset or slow progression of the disease.

50834,ViiV Healthcare Present Results of Long-Acting Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine at IDWeeK 2020,"ViiV Healthcare announces analysis showing no antiretroviral therapy interruptions due to COVID-19 across its clinical development programme for investigational, long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine","The company reported the positive findings of a pooled analysis of six ongoing clinical studies which includes P-IIb/IIIb LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE studies evaluating long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine regimen in 1,744 patients with HIV-1 infection across 16 countries
 The positive findings showed 93% of participants maintained their injection visits amid the COVID-19 with no instances of virologic failure or development of resistance and showed good tolerability
 Long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in patients who are virologically stable and suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) and has received Health Canada’s approval in Mar’2020","London, 21 October 2020 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced the positive findings of a pooled analysis of COVID-19-related impacts across the investigational long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine clinical development programme. In the midst of the global pandemic, the analysis found no antiretroviral therapy interruptions across the entirety of the ongoing clinical development programme for long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. When missed visits occurred due to the pandemic, the analysis showed they were manageable and successfully mitigated primarily by switching patients onto short periods of daily oral therapy of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, with good tolerability and no virologic failure or emerging resistance. These findings were presented today at the 2020 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) IDWeekTM.

Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research & Development at ViiV Healthcare, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with perhaps the greatest real-world test to implementing the innovative regimen of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine, which if approved, could shift the HIV treatment paradigm away from daily pills to injections administered by a healthcare provider every month or every two months. It’s reassuring to know that even in the midst of a global pandemic that has led to restricted access to some clinics and providers, there were few injection visit interruptions and those that occurred were effectively managed by providing participants with oral treatment. These findings speak to how the regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine may be adapted to meet the needs of people living with HIV who have events in their lives that could cause them to miss an injection appointment.”

The pooled analysis examined 1,744 participants across 16 countries currently taking long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine as part of the regimen’s ongoing global clinical development programme of six studies, which includes the phase IIb/IIIb LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE clinical trials. While the majority of participants (93%, 1,615) maintained their routine dosing schedule from December 2019 through the analysis end point of September 15, 2020, 129 participants (7%) in the ongoing clinical trials had a planned injection visit that was impacted by COVID-19.

To date, there have been no suspected or confirmed virologic failures observed for any participants whose planned injection visit schedules were impacted by COVID-19. Treatment interruption was prevented among impacted participants primarily by switching participants onto daily oral therapy with cabotegravir and rilpivirine (94 participants, 73%) or the daily oral standard of care antiretroviral therapy (27 participants, 21%). Seven participants (5%) were able to reschedule their long-acting injection visit. Of the participants who experienced an impact to their visit, 54 (42%) were due to clinic closure or staffing constraints, 11 (9%) were due to self-quarantine, 18 (14%) were due to confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and 46 (36%) were attributed to other reasons, including COVID-19-related travel restrictions.

One hundred ten of the 121 participants (91%) who transitioned to temporary oral therapy because of a COVID-impacted injection visit have since restarted therapy with long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Of those participants who transitioned back to injectables, the median duration of oral therapy was 51 days. Participants identified as impacted by COVID-19 will continue to be followed and data collected from that group is expected to be presented at a future medical meeting.

The long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine was approved by Health Canada in March 2020 and is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration and other global regulatory authorities. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) recently issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation for long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine in both injectable and tablet formulations. The CHMP positive opinion is one of the final steps before marketing authorisation is granted by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for use throughout the European Union.

About the long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine
The long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is an investigational regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in patients who are virologically stable and suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL). The complete regimen combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) cabotegravir, developed by ViiV Healthcare, with rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) developed by Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

INSTIs, like cabotegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Rilpivirine is an NNRTI that works by interfering with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

CABENUVA (cabotegravir and rilpivirine extended release injectable suspensions) is currently only approved in Canada.

50840,Roche Collaborates with Atea Pharmaceuticals to Develop AT-527 for COVID-19,Roche announces collaboration with Atea Pharmaceuticals to develop a potential oral treatment for COVID-19 patients,"The companies will collaborate to develop, manufacture, and distribute AT-527 to combat COVID-19. If approved, Atea will be responsible for distributing the treatment option in the US, with the option to request Genentech’s support, and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the US
 The therapy is currently being evaluated in P-II study for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 with anticipated P-III initiation in Q1’21, that explores the potential use in patients outside of the hospital setting. Additionally, AT-527 may be developed for post-exposure prophylactic settings
 AT-527 is an investigational, oral, purine nucleotide prodrug that has demonstrated in antiviral activity against several enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, including human flavivirus and coronavirus","Basel, 22 October 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that they are joining forces in the fight against COVID-19 to develop, manufacture and distribute AT-527, Atea’s investigational oral direct-acting antiviral, to people around the globe. AT-527 acts by blocking the viral RNA polymerase enzyme needed for viral replication, and is currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial for hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19. A Phase 3 clinical trial, expected to start in Q1 2021, will explore the potential use in patients outside of the hospital setting. In addition, AT-527 may be developed for post-exposure prophylactic settings.

AT-527, while being a potential oral treatment option for hospitalised patients, also holds the potential to be the first oral treatment option for COVID-19 patients that are not hospitalised.  Additionally, the manufacturing process of small-molecule DAAs allows the ability to produce large quantities of a much needed treatment. If successful, AT-527 could help treat patients early, reduce the progression of the infection, and contribute to decreasing the overall burden on health systems.

The collaboration aims to accelerate the clinical development and manufacturing of AT-527, to investigate its safety and efficacy, and to provide this potential treatment option to patients around the world as quickly as possible. If AT-527 proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Atea will be responsible for distributing this treatment option in the U.S, with the option to request Genentech’s support, and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the United States.

“The ongoing complexities of COVID-19 require multiple lines of defence. By joining forces with Atea, we hope to offer an additional treatment option for hospitalised and non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and to ease the burden on hospitals during a global pandemic.” said Bill Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals. “In jointly developing and manufacturing AT-527 at scale, we seek to make this treatment option available to as many people around the world as we possibly can.”

“Roche shares our passion for delivering innovative new medicines to address great unmet medical needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for a novel, oral antiviral to treat this highly infectious and often deadly virus,” said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “AT-527 is expected to be ideally suited to combat COVID-19 as it inhibits viral replication by interfering with viral RNA polymerase, a key component in the replication machinery of RNA viruses. Importantly, the manufacturing process for our small molecule direct-acting antiviral allows us to produce AT-527 quickly and at scale.”

About AT-527
AT-527 is an investigational, oral, purine nucleotide prodrug, which has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against several enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses, including human flaviviruses and coronaviruses. This highly selective purine nucleotide prodrug was designed to uniquely inhibit viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme that is essential for the replication of RNA viruses. Antiviral activity and safety of AT-527 has been demonstrated in Phase 2 clinical studies of hepatitis C patients, and in preclinical in-vitro assays with SARS-CoV2 virus.  AT-527 is not yet licensed or approved for any indication in the United States or any other country.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19.  We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose  the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19  (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio
a point-of-care molecular PCR test that simultaneously detects and differentiates between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B infections to support urgent triage and diagnosis (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:
Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

In August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture, and increase global supply of their investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted.

At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA –  a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

50847,GSK Presents Results of Maternal &amp; Older Adults RSV Vaccines at IDWeek 2020,GSK presents positive clinical data on maternal and older adults RSV candidate vaccines,"GSK reported that its RSV vaccines for maternal immunization (GSK3888550A) and older adults (GSK3844766A) were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in P-I/II clinical studies. Both the candidate vaccines contain a recombinant RSVPreF3, that triggers the required immune response
 The GSK3844766A was first tested in 48 healthy adults (18-40yrs.) & then in 1005 healthy older adults (60-80yrs.) with different dosages of antigen & adjuvant. The interim data 1mos. post-immunization elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity while the vaccine includes AS01 adjuvant system to boost the immune response
 GSK3888550A was tested with 3 different doses vs PBO in 502 healthy non-pregnant women over monthly visits (day 8, 31 & 91 post immunization). The study results demonstrated that vaccine rapidly boost pre-existing immunity at all dose levels & @day8 it showed a 4-fold increase in RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing Abs titers. P-III studies of both the vaccines are expected to initiate in the coming months","GSK today announced that its Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) candidate vaccines for maternal immunisation (GSK3888550A) and older adults (GSK3844766A) were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in Phase I/II clinical studies. The data were presented virtually at the ID Week Congress.

RSV is a leading cause of respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis (inflammation and congestion of the small airways or bronchioles of the lung) and pneumonia (an inflammatory condition of the lung small air sacs or alveoli) in infants and older adults. It is estimated to cause about 3 million hospitalisations of children under 5 year of age globally[1], and 177,000 hospitalisations of older people in the US alone[2].

Both candidate vaccines contain a recombinant subunit pre-fusion RSV antigen (RSVPreF3) which is believed to trigger the required immune response. The vaccine for older adults also includes GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant system[3] to boost the immune response as this population tends to show weaker immune response to vaccination than younger adults.

The vaccine candidate for older adults was first tested in 48 healthy adults (18-40 years old) and then in 1,005 healthy older adults (60-80 years old) with different dosages of antigen and adjuvant compared with a placebo. The interim data 1-month post-immunisation show that:

the candidate vaccine elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline
a close to 10 times increase of protective antibodies (RSVPreF3 IgG and RSV-A neutralising antibodies) was induced in the vaccinated group
importantly, the cellular immunity (RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cells) of the vaccinated older adults was boosted to reach similar range to that observed in the younger adults after vaccination with the non-adjuvanted formulation, despite the initial lower baseline level observed in older adults compared with young adults.
The maternal RSV candidate vaccine was tested with 3 different doses compared with placebo in 502 healthy non-pregnant women over monthly visits (Day 8, Day 31 and Day 91 post immunisation). The data show that, compared with baseline:

the investigational vaccine was able to rapidly boost the pre-existing immunity at all dose levels, leading to high levels of protective neutralising antibodies
at Day 8, a 14-fold increase in RSV-A and RSV-B neutralising antibodies titers was observed.
These two vaccines are part of a tailored, portfolio approach GSK is pursuing with three RSV candidate vaccines – maternal, paediatric and older adults – using different novel technologies aiming to help protect the populations most impacted: infants and older adults. All three candidate vaccines have received FDA fast-track designation.

Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice-President and Head of Vaccines R&D, said: “RSV is an infectious disease that can have a very serious impact on families and societies. We are delighted to see these positive results confirming our approach to develop dedicated vaccines building on the strategic use of our platform technologies for the populations most at risk from RSV infections – young infants and older adults. Our portfolio strategy takes into account the unique needs of the immune system of these vulnerable populations and we look forward to progressing these assets to Phase III trials to evaluate their potential efficacy”.

Vaccines for RSV prevention could lead to significant reductions in disease, doctor’s visits, and hospitalisations in infants, toddlers, and older adults, thus having the potential for a significant benefit to individual health in the most vulnerable populations as well as a positive impact on the burden and costs of healthcare systems around the world.

Based on available data and engagement with regulators, Phase III studies for both older adults and maternal RSV candidate vaccines are in preparation and on-track to start in the coming months, while the Phase I/II (in RSV-seronegative infants) and Phase II (in RSV-seropositive infants) studies with the paediatric RSV candidate vaccine are ongoing. Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity data on the paediatric RSV candidate vaccine in RSV-seropositive infants will be presented at European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) on 26-29 October 2020.

About GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine for older adults (GSK3844766A)

The Phase I/II study investigates the safety, reactogenicity and immune response of GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine  in older adults aged 60 to 80 (NCT03814590). This candidate vaccine contains GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant, which is also used in GSK’s shingles vaccine. The safety, reactogenicity and immune responses (humoral and cellular-mediated) were first assessed in 48 healthy adults aged 18–40 years who were vaccinated with either 30, 60 or 120 μg dose level of RSVPreF3 non-adjuvanted vaccine or placebo. Following favourable safety outcomes, 1005 adults aged 60–80 years were randomised in a 2-step staggered manner to receive 1 of the 9 RSV vaccine formulations containing either 30, 60 or 120 μg dose level of RSVPreF3, non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS01E or AS01B, or placebo.

Interim data presented at ID Week show that within one-month post-immunisation, the adjuvanted candidate vaccine has been well tolerated with no safety concerns identified. The most frequently reported adverse events were pain at injection site, fatigue and headache.

Moreover, data 1-month post-immunisation show that the candidate vaccine elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline:

High levels of RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies (geometric mean antibody concentrations were 8.4–13.5 for the 18-40 year old vaccinees, and 7.2–12.8 fold-higher in the 60–80-year-old vaccinees) and RSV-A neutralising antibodies (geometric mean antibody titers were 7.5–13.7 in the 18–40 year old vaccinees, and 5.6–9.9 fold-higher in 60–80-year-old vaccinees) were induced in all vaccinated groups.
Before vaccination, deficiency of RSVPreF3-specific T-cells (hypothesised to help promote viral clearance) was observed in older adults compared to younger adults. After vaccination, a robust RSVPreF3 CD4+ T-cells response in older adults had been boosted to reach a similar range than the one observed in younger adults, with significantly higher immune response in the groups who received the adjuvanted formulation.
About GSK’s maternal RSV candidate vaccine (GSK3888550A)

The goal of this candidate vaccine is to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants during the first months of life by transfer of maternal antibodies – an approach based on GSK’s strong expertise in maternal immunisation acquired through pertussis and flu vaccine programmes. The polyclonal nature of the humoral response boosted by this vaccine could potentially offer broad protection across a large number of RSV strains and addressing the potential issue of virus escape mutation. Maternal immunisation could help to protect infants too young to be immunised from RSV-associated infections in their first months of life – when they are the most vulnerable – without any medical intervention required thanks to the passive transmission of neutralising antibodies from the vaccinated mother to the unborn child in the last weeks of pregnancy.

In this Phase I/II study (NCT03674177), 502 healthy non-pregnant women received 1 dose of either 30, 60 or 120 μg of recombinant protein-based RSVPreF3 or placebo. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity was monitored for 6 months. The data 1-month post-immunisation show that all vaccine dose levels were well-tolerated, with no safety concerns identified: the most frequently reported solicited adverse events were minor and included pain at injection site and headache.

Moreover, the data show that the candidate vaccine elicited a rapid and persistent immune response in all RSVPreF3 groups. The immune response peaked at Day 8 with a 14-fold increase in neutralising RSV-A and RSV-B titers from baseline. The neutralising titers declined over time but a >6-fold increase was still maintained at Day 91. Anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies were boosted substantially in all groups with geometric mean concentrations of anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibody (≥ 12-fold at Day 8 and ≥ 6-fold until Day 91 vs baseline). The 60 and 120 μg dose levels of RSVPreF3 were more immunogenic than the 30 μg formulation.

Safety and immunogenicity data from the first time in pregnant women study will be presented in the first half of 2021. The data currently available provide the confidence to advance to late stage clinical work.

 About respiratory syncytial virus

Globally, there are an estimated 33 million cases of RSV annually in children less than 5 years of age, with about 3 million hospitalised and approximately 120,000 dying each year from complications associated with the infection. Nearly half of these pediatric hospitalisations and deaths occur in infants less than 6 months of age[4]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually all children in the US get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old and one to two out of every 100 children younger than 6 months of age with RSV infection may need to be hospitalised[5].

It also represents a significant health threat for older adults, with an estimated 177,000 hospitalisations and 14,000 deaths associated with RSV infections occurring in the US alone[6]. Without robust surveillance systems in several countries, global data on the burden of RSV in older adults is either lacking or likely to underestimate its significance. As global population ages, morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections including RSV to be steadily increasing.

(Nasdaq: DRNA) (the “Company” or “Dicerna”), a leading developer of investigational ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutics, today announced positive new interim data from its ongoing PHYOX™3 open-label trial of once-monthly nedosiran, an investigational candidate in development for the treatment of all three known types of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) – PH1, PH2 and PH3. PH is a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with complications in the kidneys. These results were presented as part of the American Society of Nephrology’s Kidney Week 2020 annual scientific conference.

All 13 participants (10 with PH1 and three with PH2) receiving nedosiran, who had previously completed the PHYOX1 Phase 1 trial and had reached Day 180 in the ongoing PHYOX3 trial, achieved normal (12 of 13) or near-normal (one of 13) urinary oxalate (Uox) excretions at one or more timepoints. Of these, all 10 (100%) of the participants with PH1, and two of the three (67%) participants with PH2, achieved normal Uox excretions at one or more visits. In this study, normal Uox excretions were defined as below 0.46 mmol/1.73m2 body surface area (BSA)/24 hr, and near-normal Uox excretions were defined as ranging from 0.46 to < 0.6 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr.

“For patients with PH, excessive oxalate production compromises kidney function and can have life-threatening consequences,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Dicerna. “We are encouraged by this latest interim analysis from our ongoing PHYOX3 trial showing that all PH1 and PH2 participants receiving nedosiran for six months reached the desired ranges of normal or near-normal urinary oxalate excretions. This is a promising outcome suggesting that nedosiran may meaningfully reduce hepatic oxalate overproduction, potentially slowing disease progression. We look forward to additional results from our ongoing PHYOX clinical development program, including our pivotal PHYOX2 trial, to support our planned New Drug Application submission next year.”

Key results from the interim analysis:

A total of 16 trial participants from the completed PHYOX1 trial entered the PHYOX3 trial. Of these, 13 who had reached 180 Days and had received six monthly doses in the PHYOX3 trial were included in this analysis. Three participants were not included in the efficacy analysis as they had not yet reached Day 180 at the time of the analysis.
All participants in this analysis, regardless of PH subtype, achieved normal or near-normal Uox excretion by Day 180.
92% of all participants (12 of 13) achieved normal Uox excretion at one or more visits through Day 180:
100% of participants (10 of 10) with PH1
67% of participants (2 of 3) with PH2
The single participant with PH2 who did not achieve normal Uox excretion during the analysis period reached near-normal Uox excretion rates.
The mean 24-hour Uox excretion for all 13 participants at Day 180 was in the normal range at 0.44 mmol/1.73 m2 BSA/24 hr.
62% of all participants (8 of 13) demonstrated normalized Uox excretions on at least three consecutive visits, meeting protocol-defined eligibility for gradual reduction in fluid intake requirements:
70% of participants (7 of 10) with PH1
33% of participants (1 of 3) with PH2
The mean maximum reduction in Uox excretion for all participants was 70.9% (range, 54.9% to 87.5%) by Day 180.
Nedosiran was generally well tolerated, and no serious safety concerns were identified in this ongoing study. There were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals during the observation period. Two participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis) that were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to nedosiran treatment. The most common TEAEs were mild to moderate administration-site reactions. Protocol-defined injection-site reactions (ISRs) occurred in 18.8% of participants.
Also presented at ASN Kidney Week were the results of a retrospective claims analysis of commercial plan data (excluding Medicare and Medicaid lives) from IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus (1/2014-12/2019). The analysis included a 5:1 ratio of a random 5% sample of patients without PH or secondary hyperoxaluria (SH), matched to patients diagnosed with PH (subtype specificity not available). This analysis showed that the median cost of care for patients with PH (n=324) was approximately seven times higher than patients who did not have PH (n=1,620) (p<0.001).

“The observations from this claims analysis highlight some of the higher health care costs associated with having PH,” said Thomas Koenig, vice president, global market access at Dicerna. “This analysis suggests that, even excluding patients who are on Medicare and Medicaid who may have more advanced disease, patients with PH bear higher healthcare-related costs while still facing the potential for chronic kidney stones, declining kidney health, systemic oxalosis impacting other organs and the possibility of end-stage renal disease that may require dual liver-kidney transplantation. This analysis is the first known published insight into healthcare costs associated with PH and emphasizes the need for more research into the clinical and cost burden associated with this disease.”

Both posters were presented during the “Genetic Diseases of the Kidneys: Non-Cystic – 1” session at the Kidney Week conference and will be posted in the Events & Presentations section of Dicerna’s corporate website.

About the Nedosiran PHYOX™3 Trial

The PHYOX™3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04042402) is an ongoing, open-label extension study evaluating nedosiran’s long-term safety and efficacy in participants with primary hyperoxaluria (PH), a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with recurrent renal stones and can lead to kidney failure. The PHYOX3 trial is open to participants six years of age or older with PH1 or PH2 who have participated in any previous PHYOX clinical development program trial, as well as their siblings with PH between the ages of six to 18. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate annual rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function and nedosiran’s ability to preserve remaining kidney function. The PHYOX3 trial also will evaluate nedosiran’s long-term safety and effect on new stone formation, nephrocalcinosis, and the durability of reducing Uox levels, as well as its potential to enable the gradual decrease or elimination of their disease management practices.

About Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)

Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a family of ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that initially manifest with complications in the kidneys. There are three known types of PH (PH1, PH2 and PH3), each resulting from a mutation in one of three different genes. These genetic mutations cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the overproduction of a substrate called oxalate. Abnormal production and accumulation of oxalate leads to recurrent kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney disease that may progress to end-stage renal disease requiring intensive dialysis. Compromised renal function eventually results in the accumulation of oxalate in a wide range of organs including the skin, bones, eyes and heart. In the most severe cases, symptoms start in the first year of life. A combined liver-kidney transplant may be undertaken to resolve PH1 or PH2, but it is an invasive solution with limited availability and high morbidity that requires lifelong immune suppression to prevent organ rejection. There are currently no approved medications for the treatment of PH. Patients are limited to using hyperhydration and medication to attempt to increase solubility of oxalate in urine. Despite these interventions, oxalate may continue to accumulate in the kidneys and other organs, causing damage.

About Nedosiran

Nedosiran is the only RNAi drug candidate in development for primary hyperoxaluria (PH) types 1, 2 and 3 and is Dicerna’s most advanced product candidate utilizing the proprietary GalXC™ RNAi technology platform. Nedosiran is designed to inhibit the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme – an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in a common pathway resulting in oxalate overproduction in patients with PH1, PH2 and PH3. Dicerna is evaluating the safety and efficacy of nedosiran in patients with all known forms of PH as part of its PHYOX™ clinical development program.

50923,Gilead's Veklury (remdesivir) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Treatment for COVID-19,U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Gilead’s Antiviral Veklury® (remdesivir) for Treatment of COVID-19,"The approval is based on three studies including P-lll ACTT-1 study assessing the efficacy and safety of a 10-day treatment course of Veklury vs PBO in 1063 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 receiving the treatment with SOC. The other two studies include two P-II OLE studies (SIMPLE-Severe trial & SIMPLE-Moderate trial)
 ACTT-1 trial results: improvement in time to recovery in overall study population & in patients who required oxygen (10 vs 15days & 11 vs 18days); reduction in disease progression in patients needing oxygen, reduction in new mechanical ventilation or ECMO (13% vs 23%)
 Additionally, FDA also issued a new EUA for the use of Veklury to treat hospitalized pediatric patients aged <12yrs. weighing at least 3.5 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to <40 kg with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 for whom use of an IV agent is clinically appropriate. Veklury is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States.","FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the antiviral drug Veklury® (remdesivir) for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. As an antiviral drug, Veklury works to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, Veklury is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States. The drug is now widely available in hospitals across the country, following early investments to rapidly expand manufacturing capacity to increase supply.

In the United States, Veklury is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care. Veklury is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Veklury or any of its components; please see below for additional Important Safety Information for Veklury.

This approval is based on three randomized controlled trials including the recently published, final results of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 ACTT-1 trial, which showed that treatment with Veklury resulted in clinically meaningful improvements across multiple outcome assessments compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Based on the strength of these data, Veklury has become a standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.

“The approval of Veklury marks an important milestone in efforts to help address the pandemic by offering an effective treatment that helps patients recover faster and, in turn, helps preserve scarce healthcare resources,” said Barry Zingman, MD, Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, New York. “The availability of a rigorously tested treatment that can significantly speed recovery and offers other benefits such as lower rates of progression to mechanical ventilation, provides hospitalized patients and their families important hope and offers healthcare providers a critical tool as they care for patients in need.”

“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilead has worked relentlessly to help find solutions to this global health crisis. It is incredible to be in the position today, less than one year since the earliest case reports of the disease now known as COVID-19, of having an FDA-approved treatment in the U.S. that is available for all appropriate patients in need,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “The speed and rigor with which Veklury has been developed and approved in the U.S. reflect the shared commitment of Gilead, government agencies and clinical trial investigators to advance well-tolerated, effective treatment options for the fight against COVID-19. We will continue to work at speed with the aim of enhancing patient outcomes with Veklury to ensure all patients with COVID-19 have the best chance at recovery.”

In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ACTT-1 trial, Veklury significantly improved time to recovery as compared to placebo – by five days in the overall study population (10 vs. 15 days; rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; p<0.001) and seven days in patients who required oxygen support at baseline (11 vs. 18 days; rate ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.52). As a secondary endpoint, Veklury also reduced disease progression in patients needing oxygen, resulting in a significantly lower incidence of new mechanical ventilation or ECMO (13% vs. 23%; 95% CI, -15 to -4). In the overall patient population, there was a trend toward reduced mortality with Veklury compared with placebo at Day 29 (11.4% vs. 15.2%, HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Additional mortality data from a post-hoc analysis were published in the New England Journal of Medicineon October 8, 2020.

The ACTT-1 trial results are complemented by results of two Phase 3 open-label trials of Veklury conducted in adult patients with severe and moderate COVID-19. The SIMPLE-Severe trial, conducted in hospitalized patients who required supplemental oxygen and who were not mechanically ventilated, found that a five-day or a 10-day treatment course of Veklury achieved similar clinical outcomes (odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.12). The SIMPLE-Moderate trial, conducted in hospitalized patients who did not require supplemental oxygen, showed statistically improved clinical outcomes with a five-day treatment course of Veklury compared with standard of care (odds ratio 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.48; p=0.017). The odds of improvement in clinical status with the 10-day treatment course of Veklury versus standard of care were also favorable, trending toward but not reaching statistical significance (odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.95).

The incidence of adverse events associated with Veklury was similar to placebo in the ACTT-1 trial. Rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) were numerically higher in the placebo group compared with the Veklury group. Treatment discontinuation, all-cause grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were similar across groups. In the SIMPLE-Severe trial, the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of subjects in either the Veklury 5-day or 10-day group, respectively, were nausea (5% vs 3%), AST increased (3% vs 6%), and ALT increased (2% vs 7%). In the SIMPLE-Moderate trial, the most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5% of subjects in the Veklury groups was nausea (7% in the 5-day group, 4% in the 10-day group).

In parallel with the FDA approval of Veklury, the FDA also issued a new Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of Veklury to treat hospitalized pediatric patients under 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 for whom use of an intravenous (IV) agent is clinically appropriate. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal submission, review and approval process for the use of Veklury in this patient population. The use of Veklury in pediatric patients under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg has not been approved by FDA, and the safety and efficacy of Veklury for this use has not been established. For information about the authorized use of Veklury in pediatric patients and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

About the ACTT-1 Trial

The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial ACTT-1 (NTC04280705) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 10-day treatment course of Veklury versus placebo in 1,063 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 who also were receiving treatment with standard of care.

The primary outcome measure of ACTT-1 was time to recovery within 29 days after randomization. Recovery was defined as discharged from the hospital without limitations on activities, discharged from the hospital with limitations on activities and/or requiring home oxygen, or hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care.

About the SIMPLE Trials

Gilead’s two open-label Phase 3 trials of Veklury were conducted in countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19 infections and included U.S. trial sites that serve diverse communities.

The SIMPLE-Severe trial (NCT04292899) was a randomized, open-label multi-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of Veklury plus standard of care in 397 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, an SpO2 of ≤94% on room air, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. The primary endpoint was clinical status on Day 14 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. Treatment with Veklury was stopped in subjects who were discharged from the hospital prior to completion of their protocol-defined duration of treatment.

The SIMPLE-Moderate trial (NCT04292730) was a randomized, controlled, open-label multi-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of Veklury plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in 600 hospitalized adult patients with moderate COVID-19. Moderate COVID-19 was defined as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, SpO2 >94% and radiological evidence of pneumonia. The primary endpoint was clinical status on Day 11 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale.

As announced on October 1, 2020, Gilead is now meeting real-time demand for Veklury in the United States and anticipates meeting global demand for Veklury in October, even in the event of potential future surges of COVID-19.

U.S. Important Safety Information for Veklury

Contraindication

VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to VEKLURY or any of its components.
Warnings and precautions

Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions: Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, has been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY. Monitor patients under close medical supervision for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of VEKLURY. Symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates (maximum infusion time ≤120 minutes) can potentially prevent these reactions. If a severe infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment (see Contraindications).
Increased risk of transaminase elevations: Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY; these elevations have also been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19. Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients (see Dosage and administration). Consider discontinuing VEKLURY if ALT levels increase to >10x ULN. Discontinue VEKLURY if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.
Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine: Coadministration of VEKLURY with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended due to antagonism observed in cell culture, which may lead to a decrease in antiviral activity of VEKLURY
Adverse reactions

The most common adverse reaction (≥5% all grades) was nausea.
The most common lab abnormalities (≥5% all grades) were increases in ALT and AST.
Drug interactions

Drug interaction trials of VEKLURY and other concomitant medications have not been conducted in humans.
Dosage and administration

Dosage: For adults and pediatric patients ≥12 years old and weighing ≥40 kg: 200 mg on Day 1, followed by once-daily maintenance doses of 100 mg from Day 2 administered only via intravenous infusion over 30 to 120 minutes.
Treatment duration: For patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): 5 days; may be extended up to 5 additional days (10 days total) if clinical improvement is not observed. For patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO: 10 days.
Testing prior to and during treatment: Perform eGFR, hepatic laboratory, and prothrombin time testing prior to initiating VEKLURY and during use as clinically appropriate.
Renal impairment: VEKLURY is not recommended in individuals with eGFR <30 mL/min.
Dose preparation and administration: See full Prescribing Information.
Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy: There are insufficient human data on the use of VEKLURY during pregnancy. Pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk for serious morbidity and mortality. VEKLURY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.
Lactation: It is not known whether VEKLURY can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.
U.S. Indication for Veklury

VEKLURY is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.

50930,UCB's Vimpat (lacosamide) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures,UCB’s anti-epileptic drug VIMPAT[®] (lacosamide) receives EU CHMP positive opinion for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures,"The EMA’s CHMP has adopted a positive opinion on a license extension for Vimpat (lacosamide) and Lacosamide UCB (lacosamide) as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment for PGTCS in adults, adolescents, and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalized epilepsy
 The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-lll study assessing lacosamide as an adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled PGTCS. The therapy lowered the risk of developing a second PGTCS during a 24wks. period and demonstrated a higher rate of freedom from PGTCS during the treatment period
 The company expects the EC’s formal approval decision before the end of 2020, that broaden the clinical application of Vimpat and make a new treatment option available to aid the management of PGTCS","Brussels (Belgium), 22 October 2020, 07:00 (CEST): UCB today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion on a licence extension for its anti-epileptic drugs VIMPAT® (lacosamide) and Lacosamide UCB (lacosamide) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.

The positive opinion is based, in part, on results from a phase 3 study of lacosamide as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS), recently published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.6

In the study, UCB’s anti-epileptic Drug (AED) lowered the risk of developing a second primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure during a 24-week period and demonstrated a significantly higher rate of freedom from PGTCS during the treatment period compared with placebo. Lacosamide was generally tolerated by patients enrolled in the study.

Idiopathic generalized epilepsy, (IGEs) account for 20%–40% of all epilepsies2 and are characterized by different generalized seizure types (absence, myoclonic and PGTCS).3 Patients living with generalized tonic-clonic seizures have an increased risk of injury4 and those who experienced three or more in one year had a fifteen-fold increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.5

“People living with uncontrolled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures face tremendous challenges and currently have few treatment options available to them. This form of epilepsy can be devastating, significantly impacting the quality of a patient’s life. Additionally, many patients are refractory, meaning they do not respond to currently approved medicines. This unpredictability can present numerous challenges and barriers”, explained Iris Loew-Friedrich, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, UCB. “We are very pleased the CHMP has recognised the impact of PGTCS, and the importance of broadening the number of adjunctive therapies available to people living with this type of epilepsy”.

The European Commission’s (EC) formal approval decision is expected before the end of 2020, which would further broaden the clinical application of VIMPAT® and make a new treatment option available to aid the management of PGTCS.

“UCB remains committed to strengthening our leadership in epilepsy and to investigating new approaches and innovative solutions to deliver improved outcomes and experiences to the global epilepsy community. This applies equally to our current expansive in-market epilepsy portfolio as well as to our exciting pipeline. We know that people living with PGTCS currently have limited treatment options. With today’s CHMP positive opinion we’re excited that we’re one step closer to having an approved medicine to support the European epilepsy community,” explained Charl van Zyl, Executive Vice President & Head of Neurology Solutions, UCB.

VIMPAT® is currently not approved for PGTCS in any country in the world. In addition to this CHMP positive opinion, regulatory reviews for use of VIMPAT as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy four years of age and older compared to placebo are underway in the U.S., Japan, and Australia.

About VIMPAT®  in the EU 
VIMPAT® was first launched in the European Union in September 2008, as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adult and adolescent (16-18 years) patients with epilepsy.

In countries of the EU, VIMPAT® is available as film-coated tablets, syrup and solution for infusion. Lacosamide solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.

Important Safety Information about VIMPAT® in the EU and EEA9  
VIMPAT® is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. VIMPAT® therapy can be initiated with either oral or IV administration. For the paediatric population, the physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A single loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and CNS adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment as well.  Based on data in adults, in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered, but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered, but further dose titration (> 200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease, a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Treatment with VIMPAT® has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT® have been observed in clinical studies.  VIMPAT® should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as patients with known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial ischaemia/infarction, heart failure, structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction, including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products, as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an ECG before a Vimpat dose increase above 400mg/day and after Vimpat is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled trials of VIMPAT® in epilepsy patients, atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy trials and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience, AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions, ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases, these events have led to asystole, cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow, rapid or irregular pulse, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect.The syrup contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml, equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: VIMPAT® may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. VIMPAT® treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of VIMPAT® on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are dizziness, headache, diplopia, and nausea. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions (≥1% – <10%) are depression, confusional state, insomnia, balance disorder, memory impairment, cognitive disorder, somnolence, tremor, nystagmus, hypoesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, paraesthesia, vision blurred, vertigo, tinnitus, vomiting, constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, pruritus, rash, muscle spasms, gait disturbance, asthenia, fatigue, irritability, feeling drunk, injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration), irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration), fall, and skin laceration, contusion. The use of VIMPAT® is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur. The safety profile of lacosamide in placebo-controlled and in open-label studies (n=408) in adjunctive therapy in children from 4 years of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults although the frequency of some adverse reactions (somnolence, vomiting and convulsion) was increased and additional adverse reactions (nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, lethargy and abnormal behaviour) have been reported in paediatric patients: nasopharyngitis (15.7 %), vomiting (14.7 %), somnolence (14.0 %), dizziness (13.5 %), pyrexia (13.0 %), convulsion (7.8 %), decreased appetite (5.9 %), pharyngitis (4.7 %), lethargy (2.7 %) and abnormal behaviour (1.7 %).
Laboratory abnormalities: Abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in placebo-controlled trials with VIMPAT® in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Elevations of ALT to ≥3xULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of VIMPAT® patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms, DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, VIMPAT® should be discontinued.

Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.

 The focus of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of DS-1055 for further study and is expected to enroll ~40 patients across the US and Japan. The company will integrate novel technologies with expertise in Ab biology to develop clinical candidates
 DS-1055 is a mAb designed to target GARP and to promote antitumor immunity through the depletion of GARP positive Tregs","Tokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (October 22, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced today that the first patient has been dosed in a first-in-human global phase 1 study evaluating DS-1055, a GARP directed immuno-oncology therapy, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on standard treatments including checkpoint inhibitors.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly impacted the treatment paradigm for several cancers over the past decade with improved survival for subsets of patients, but the majority of patients do not respond to current therapies or eventually develop resistance.1  GARP is highly expressed on activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) and contributes to their immunosuppressive activity.2  Research suggests that targeting GARP on Tregs may be a promising new immune intervention strategy.2 There are no GARP directed therapies currently approved for cancer treatment.

“We are pleased to initiate clinical development to further evaluate the novel mechanism behind DS-1055, which was specifically designed to decrease the number of GARP expressing regulatory T cells and restore antitumor immune response,” said Arnaud Lesegretain, Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Alpha Portfolio, Daiichi Sankyo. “Evidence suggests that DS-1055 could serve as a new type of immune-based therapy for patients with various cancers, including those resistant or refractory to checkpoint inhibitors.”

About the Study
The first-in-human, global, multi-center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DS-1055 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic head and neck, gastric and esophageal cancers and other tumor types. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of DS-1055 for further study.

The study will evaluate safety endpoints including dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker endpoints will also be assessed.

Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in the U.S. and Japan. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04419532).

About DS-1055
DS-1055 is a monoclonal antibody designed to target GARP (Glycoprotein-A Repetitions Predominant), a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of activated Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. DS-1055 was designed to promote antitumor immunity through the depletion of GARP positive Tregs.

Tregs are involved in immune tolerance and have strong immunosuppressive activity.3  Tregs are accumulated in the tumor microenvironment, where they are activated and inhibit antitumor immunity through various mechanisms leading to suppression of effector T cells with antitumor activity.3 Tregs also cause resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.1 High Treg presence in the tumor microenvironment is associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer.4

Targeting GARP, which is selectively expressed on activated Tregs and contributes to the function of Tregs, may be a way to decrease the number of functional Tregs in the tumor microenvironment and restore antitumor immunity.2 Preclinical evidence has shown that depletion of Tregs results in antitumor activity.5

DS-1055 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Additional data demonstrated that SNF472 strongly inhibits valvular calcification in an in vitro model of porcine aortic valve
 SNF472 is an inhibitor of vascular calcification currently in P-III study, acts by targeting the deposition of solid calcium (hydroxyapatite, HAP) in the CV system. The company is showcasing new data on SNF472 in four presentations including one oral session and three ePoster sessions at virtual ASN Kidney Week 2020","Palma, Spain and San Diego, USA, October 22, 2020 – Sanifit, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for vascular calcification disorders, today announced the presentation of new data on lead candidate SNF472 today at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2020 Annual Meeting.

SNF472 is a first-in-class inhibitor of vascular calcification currently in Phase 3 clinical development. It is the only drug candidate in clinical trials which directly targets the deposition of solid calcium (hydroxyapatite, HAP) in the cardiovascular system, a major driver of morbidity and mortality in renal disease patients. At today’s virtual ASN conference Sanifit is showcasing new data on SNF472 in four presentations including one oral session and three ePoster sessions.

Today’s oral presentation by Dr. Glenn Chertow, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Stanford University, provides additional insight from the Phase 2b CaLIPSO study (positive primary data published in Circulation in November 2019), and shows that SNF472 consistently slowed progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) across key subgroups of patients on hemodialysis participating in the study. The benefit was observed in patients receiving contemporary treatment of end-stage kidney disease, including phosphate binders, calcimimetics, statins and other standard of care therapies. An ePoster also published today spotlights the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and exposure-response analyses from the CaLIPSO trial. Higher SNF472 exposure and ex-vivo inhibition of HAP crystallization (pharmacodynamic activity) correlated with a reduction in progression of coronary calcification in patients, and there was no drug accumulation.

Sanifit is also presenting the design of its ongoing Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study called CALCIPHYX in an ePoster. The study is evaluating efficacy and safety of SNF472 for the treatment of patients with calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy, or CUA), a highly morbid disease of vascular calcification and skin necrosis.

Additional data being presented today also demonstrates that SNF472 strongly inhibits valvular calcification in an in vitro model of porcine aortic valve.

“This is a robust set of data and we are pleased to be presenting at the ASN virtual meeting this year. In particular, we are delighted to share details of the innovative design of our Phase 3 CALCIPHYX trial, which includes alternate primary endpoints and is currently actively recruiting according to our plan,” said Joan Perelló, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sanifit. “These data demonstrate SNF472’s potential to help patients around the world suffering from consequences of vascular calcification. There are no currently approved treatments for calciphylaxis and we hope that SNF472 will provide benefit for these patients.”

The ASN conference is being held from 22-25 October and is fully virtual, with further information available on the ASN website. Links to abstracts and schedule details for presentations are below:

 The presentation expands on previously reported positive data showing vadadustat achieved clear and consistent results across 1EPs & 2EPs
 Vadadustat is an oral HIF-PH inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability and is also being evaluated in P-III PRO2TECT for anemia due to CKD in adult patients, not on dialysis. The company plans to submit NDA to the US FDA for anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients in 2021","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA) today announced the presentation of clinical data from its global INNO2VATE Phase 3 program, which demonstrated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients on dialysis, at American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2020 Reimagined (ASN Kidney Week). Vadadustat is Akebia’s investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) in development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD.

“The data presented today build on the positive top-line efficacy and safety results from INNO2VATE that were previously reported in May. More specifically, vadadustat’s cardiovascular safety profile in dialysis patients is further reinforced by newly presented data clearly showing vadadustat achieved non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa on MACE, expanded MACE, cardiovascular MACE, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. These results were also consistent across multiple pre-specified populations,” said Kai-Uwe Eckardt, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Head of the Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care Medicine at the Charité in Berlin and Co-Chair of the independent Executive Steering Committee for INNO2VATE. “Left untreated, anemia in dialysis patients results in high transfusion requirements and severely reduces a patient’s quality of life. The INNO2VATE results demonstrate that vadadustat could represent an attractive new oral treatment option for patients new to and already established on dialysis, upon approval.”

Results from INNO2VATE are being presented today at ASN Kidney Week during a presentation titled, “Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat vs Darbepoetin Alfa for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease” (Abstract TH-OR01).

Highlights of the INNO2VATE ASN Kidney Week Presentation:

Efficacy:

Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease: Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint

Safety:

As previously reported, vadadustat achieved the primary safety endpoint of the INNO2VATE program, defined as non-inferiority of vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa in time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), which is the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal stroke across both INNO2VATE studies.
INNO2VATE results on key secondary safety endpoints were clear and consistent. Vadadustat demonstrated non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa in analyses of expanded MACE, cardiovascular MACE, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.
Global Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Vadadustat for Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease: Primary and Key Secondary Safety Endpoints

The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the incident dialysis patient (Correction/Conversion) study in vadadustat treated patients was 83.8% and 85.5% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were hypertension (16.2%/ 12.9%) and diarrhea (10.1%/ 9.7%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were lower in vadadustat treated patients at 49.7% compared to 56.5% for darbepoetin alfa treated patients. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the prevalent dialysis patient (Conversion) study in the vadadustat treated patients was 88.3%, and 89.3% in darbepoetin alfa treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa treated patients were diarrhea (13.0%/ 10.1%), pneumonia (11.0%/ 9.7%), hypertension (10.6%/ 13.8%), and hyperkalemia (9.0%/ 10.8%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were slightly lower for vadadustat treated patients at 55.0% and 58.3% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients.
“We could not be more excited and pleased with such compelling results across our clinical development program in patients on dialysis for vadadustat,” said John P. Butler, President and CEO of Akebia Therapeutics. “The clear and consistent data set the stage for the potential approval of vadadustat and underscore its potential as a new oral standard of care for treating patients on dialysis with anemia due to CKD, including both incident and prevalent dialysis patients, upon approval. We look forward to bringing this innovative therapy to patients on dialysis globally, upon approval, and remain on track to submit an NDA as early as possible next year.”

Akebia’s vadadustat development program also includes PRO2TECT, the global Phase 3 program for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients not on dialysis. Results from this program will be presented at ASN Kidney Week in a late-breaking presentation on October 23, 2020. Akebia plans to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a New Drug Application (NDA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients as early as possible in 2021. In addition, Akebia and its collaborator, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., are working in close collaboration to prepare a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) next year.

About the INNO2VATE Global Phase 3 Program of Vadadustat
Akebia’s global INNO2VATE program included two separate Phase 3 studies for incident dialysis patients (Correction/Conversion) and prevalent dialysis patients (Conversion), which collectively enrolled 3,923 adult patients on dialysis with anemia due to CKD. The INNO2VATE incident dialysis patient study evaluated 369 incident dialysis patients and the prevalent dialysis study evaluated 3,554 prevalent dialysis patients. Both INNO2VATE studies were global, multicenter, open-label, sponsor-blind, active-controlled (darbepoetin alfa – an injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agent), non-inferiority studies. In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral vadadustat or injectable darbepoetin alfa.  Efficacy and safety results were measured against non-inferiority margins agreed upon with the FDA and the EMA.

About Anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Anemia is a condition in which a person lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body’s tissues. It commonly occurs in people with CKD because their kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that helps regulate production of red blood cells. Anemia due to CKD can have a profound impact on a person’s quality of life as it can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. Left untreated, anemia leads to deterioration in health and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people with CKD.  

About Vadadustat
Vadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat is in global Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any regulatory authority with the exception of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). In Japan, vadadustat is approved as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients.

51004,AstraZeneca Resumes P-III Study of AZD1222 Against COVID-19 in the US,FDA authorises restart of the COVID-19 AZD1222 vaccine US Phase III trial,"The US FDA authorizes the restart of the P-III clinical study in the US following the resumption of trials in other countries in recent weeks. The FDA reviewed all safety data from studies globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial
 A voluntary pause across all global studies was triggered on Sept 06, 2020, to allow the examination of safety data by independent monitoring committees. AstraZeneca has resumed the clinical trials across the globe with regulators in the US, UK, Brazil, South Africa, and Japan confirming that it was safe to do so
 While trials are ongoing, AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue to provide information to regulators, study investigators, and participants according to clinical trial and regulatory standards","Clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, have resumed across the world with regulators in the US, UK, Brazil, South Africa and Japan confirming that it was safe to do so.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today authorised the restart in the US, following the resumption of trials in other countries in recent weeks. The FDA reviewed all safety data from trials globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial.

As part of the standard review process for trial safety events, a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials was triggered on 6 September to allow the examination of safety data by independent monitoring committees. The recommendations from these reviews have been supported by international regulators, who also confirmed that the trials were safe to resume.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “The restart of clinical trials across the world is great news as it allows us to continue our efforts to develop this vaccine to help defeat this terrible pandemic. We should be reassured by the care taken by independent regulators to protect the public and ensure the vaccine is safe before it is approved for use.”

It is not unusual that in large scale vaccine trials, some participants will become unwell, and every case has to be evaluated to ensure the careful assessment of safety.

Results from the late-stage trials are anticipated later this year, depending on the rate of infection within the communities where the clinical trials are being conducted. Data readouts will be submitted to regulators and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Rolling reviews of the vaccine programme have already begun in countries where this regulatory pathway has been established, providing regulators access to data as soon as they become available.

While trials are ongoing, AstraZeneca and Oxford University will continue to provide information to regulators, study investigators and participants according to clinical trial and regulatory standards.1-5

AZD1222
AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

The agreement allows the two companies to replicate the advancements that have already been launched in Japan, where Eisai has developed and launched a new digital tool using the CBB, named NouKNOW
 The collaboration is an expansion of an existing agreement signed in 2019, under which Eisai had exclusive development and commercialization rights in Japan for all cognitive function tests including CBB
 Eisai and Cogstate will work together for the development of digital tools for simpler self-checks of cognitive function and diagnostic tool development for HCPs to promote greater awareness of brain performance globally","MELBOURNE, Australia, Oct. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Cogstate, Ltd. (Headquarters: Melbourne, Australia and New Haven, USA, CEO: Brad O’Connor, “Cogstate”) announced today that the companies have entered into a collaboration whereby Eisai has secured the global development rights and exclusive commercialization rights of all cognitive function tests developed by Cogstate, including the “Cogstate Brief BatteryTM” (CBB) for use in healthcare and other markets. This global licensing deal is an expansion of an existing partnership executed in August 2019 whereby Eisai secured exclusive development and commercialization rights in Japan for all cognitive function tests developed by Cogstate, including the CBB. Both companies plan to proceed with development globally of CBB as a tool for individuals to self-assess brain performance to support healthy lifestyle choices and preventative measures in daily life, as well as a medical device to aid healthcare professionals in clinical diagnosis decisions.

Developed by Cogstate, the CBB is a scientifically validated digital tool that enables cognitive function self-checks and consists of four tests evaluating psychomotor function, attention, learning and memory, and working memory. In the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the CBB has been adapted as a medical device named “CognigramTM” that has achieved marketing authorization by regulators in these jurisdictions and provides informative results for healthcare professionals to support clinical examination to aid in the diagnosis of MCI and dementia.

In its medium-term business plan, EWAY2025, Eisai is aiming to become a “Medico Societal Innovator” (a company that changes society through creating medicines and providing solutions). Eisai is creating next-generation medical remedies focused on the neurology and oncology areas as well as building disease ecosystem platforms, in order to provide environments and solutions including digital solutions for early diagnosis and early treatment.

Cogstate aims to make assessment of brain health as simple, common and informative as assessment of blood pressure. Cogstate’s technology, which is easy to use and available in over 70 languages, is supported by extensive scientific validation, including more than 600 peer reviewed publications. Cogstate technology has been used extensively in clinical trials, including trials conducted by Eisai.

The global agreement between Eisai and Cogstate will allow the two companies to replicate many of the advancements that have already been launched in Japan, where Eisai has developed and launched a new digital tool using the CBB, named “NouKNOWTM” (pronounced “NOH-NOH”), a non-medical device for self-assessment of brain performance (brain health). Eisai is currently investigating the possibility of developing a medical device using the CBB in Japan.

In recent years, various research has demonstrated the possibility that decline in brain performance may be mitigated through major readjustments to lifestyle, such as regular exercise and sleep, a well-balanced diet, and social interaction. However, according to a survey by Eisai, the number of people taking correct preventive actions or habitually performing self-checks of cognitive function are few, with disparities (“chasms”) existing against the incorporation of these habits into daily lifestyle.

As a result of these findings, in Japan, Eisai is constructing a dementia platform, called “Easiit”, with the goal of erasing these chasms. Core to this platform will be the brain-performance self-check tool “NouKNOW” and the “Easiit App” which aims to contribute to the promotion of health practices through data visualization of brain and body health insights.

It can be expected that the use of “NouKNOW” to perform periodic self-assessments of brain performance among the generation currently in their prime working years, along with the use of the “Easiit App” for the adjustment of lifestyle and practice of preventive measures in daily life, will become an opportunity for the creation of better brain and body health.

Through this agreement, Eisai and Cogstate will work together for the development of digital tools for simpler self-checks of cognitive function and diagnostic tool development for healthcare professionals to promote greater awareness of brain performance globally, thus contributing to the realization of well-being for all.

 In all patient cohorts participating in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, the safety profile was like the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. In Mar’2020, the US FDA granted FT designation to the therapy for CKD based on its ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY study with its expected results in 2022
 In 2019, the US FDA granted FT designation to Jardiance for the reduction of the risk of CV death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with HF based on its EMPEROR program, which consists of two P-III studies EMPEROR-Reduced & EMPEROR-Preserved","RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Findings from a new exploratory sub-analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced phase III trial showed that Jardiance® (empagliflozin) reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney events in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction – with and without diabetes – regardless of chronic kidney disease status at baseline. These results were shared today as an oral presentation at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2020 and published in Circulation, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced.

“On their own, heart failure and chronic kidney disease are each associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and premature death from cardiovascular causes. The presence of one condition often accelerates the onset and progression of the other, further increasing this risk and leading to poorer prognoses,” said Faiez Zannad, M.D., Ph.D., EMPEROR Program clinical investigator and Emeritus Professor of Therapeutics at the University of Lorraine, France. “In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin demonstrated a consistent reduction in the risk of the composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations, while slowing kidney function decline, in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with and without chronic kidney disease. This is promising news for the growing population of adults suffering from both heart failure and chronic kidney disease.”

As previously reported, EMPEROR-Reduced showed Jardiance reduced the relative risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by 25% and of first and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure by 30%, and slowed the decline in eGFR, a measure of kidney function, in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with and without diabetes. An additional exploratory analysis showed that Jardiance decreased the relative risk of a composite kidney endpoint*, including end stage kidney disease and a profound loss of kidney function, by 50%. In this new analysis of all endpoints, these benefits were consistently observed in subgroups of patients with and without chronic kidney disease at baseline, including patients with severe renal impairment. In all patient cohorts participating in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, the safety profile was similar to the well-established safety profile of Jardiance.

“Over half of people with heart failure have moderate to severe chronic kidney disease, yet, there remains a need for new treatment options that address these interconnected conditions,” said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H, M.H.A, vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism & Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “These findings continue to show the potential of Jardiance to help improve the lives of adults living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, including heart failure and chronic kidney disease.”

“Heart failure and chronic kidney disease are common, life-threatening diseases that require improved treatment options. The EMPOWER clinical development program, including our ongoing EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, explores the potential role Jardiance may play in improving outcomes for people with these conditions,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. “The new findings from EMPEROR-Reduced will help us achieve our goal of redefining how people living with these conditions are treated.”

In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to Jardiance for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, demonstrating the urgent need for new treatment options for people living with the condition. This designation covers the ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY trial, which is investigating the effect of Jardiance on the progression of kidney disease and occurrence of cardiovascular death in adults with established chronic kidney disease, with and without diabetes. Results from EMPA-KIDNEY are expected in 2022.

The FDA also granted Fast Track designation in June 2019 to Jardiance for the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with heart failure. This designation is for the EMPEROR program, which consists of the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials. EMPEROR-Preserved is exploring the effect of Jardiance on cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, an area that currently has no approved treatment options. EMPEROR-Preserved results are expected in 2021. Jardiance is not indicated for the treatment of heart failure.

The EMPEROR and EMPA-KIDNEY studies are part of the EMPOWER clinical program, the broadest and most comprehensive of any SGLT2 inhibitor, exploring the impact of Jardiance on the lives of people across the spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.

*Composite exploratory endpoint included chronic dialysis or renal transplant or sustained reduction of  ≥40% in eGFR (CKD-EPI) or a sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (for patients with baseline eGFR ≥30) or sustained eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2 (for patients with baseline eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2).

About the EMPEROR Heart Failure Studies
The EMPEROR (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in patients with chrOnic heaRt failure) heart failure studies are two phase III, randomized, double-blind trials investigating once-daily Jardiance compared with placebo in adults with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction*, both with and without diabetes, who are receiving current standard of care:

EMPEROR-Reduced [NCT03057977] investigated the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure
Number of patients: 3,730
Completion: 2020
EMPEROR-Preserved [NCT03057951] investigates the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure [Time Frame: up to 38 months]
Anticipated number of patients: approx. 5,990
Estimated completion: 2021
*Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. When the heart relaxes, the ventricle refills with blood.

HFrEF occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively, and less blood is pumped out to the body compared with a normally functioning heart.
HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricle does not fill with enough blood, so less blood can enter the heart compared with a normally functioning heart.
About the EMPOWER Program
The Alliance has developed the EMPOWER program to explore the impact of Jardiance on major clinical cardiovascular and renal outcomes in a spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. Cardio-renal-metabolic conditions are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and account for up to 20 million deaths annually. Through the EMPOWER program, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are working to advance knowledge of these interconnected systems and create care which offers integrated, multi-organ benefits. Comprised of nine clinical trials and two real-world evidence studies, EMPOWER reinforces the long-term commitment of the Alliance to improve outcomes for people living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. With 377,000 adults estimated to have enrolled worldwide upon completion of the studies, it is one of the broadest and most comprehensive clinical programs for an SGLT2 inhibitor to date.

The development program encompasses:

EMPEROR-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure
EMPEROR-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure
EMPULSE, in adults hospitalized for acute heart failure and stabilized to improve clinical and patient reported outcomes
EMPACT-MI, to evaluate all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with and without type 2 diabetes who have had an acute myocardial infarction, with the aim to prevent heart failure and improve outcomes
EMPA-KIDNEY, in adults with established chronic kidney disease to reduce the progression of kidney disease and the occurrence of cardiovascular death
EMPERIAL-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to evaluate functional ability and patient reported outcomes
EMPERIAL-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to evaluate functional ability and patient-reported outcomes
EMPA-REG OUTCOME®, in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death
EMPRISE, two non-interventional studies (U.S. and EU-Asia) of the effectiveness, safety, healthcare utilization and cost of care of empagliflozin in routine clinical practice in adults with type 2 diabetes across the cardiovascular risk continuum
About Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Conditions
Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are driven to transform care for people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, a group of interconnected disorders that affect more than one billion people worldwide and are a leading cause of death.

The cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems are interconnected, and share many of the same risk factors and pathological pathways along the disease continuum. Dysfunction in one system may accelerate the onset of others, resulting in progression of interconnected diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney disease, which in turn leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Conversely, improving the health of one system can lead to positive effects throughout the others.

Through our research and treatments, our goal is to support people’s health, restoring the harmony between the interconnected cardio-renal-metabolic systems and reducing their risk of serious complications. As part of our commitment to those whose health is jeopardized by cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, we will continue embracing a multidisciplinary approach towards care and focusing our resources on filling treatment gaps.

What is JARDIANCE? (www.jardiance.com)
JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.

JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease.

JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.

Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.

JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:

Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up.


You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:
have low blood pressure
take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)
are on a low salt diet
have kidney problems
are 65 years of age or older.
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take JARDIANCE may get vaginal yeast infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), and/or vaginal itching.
Yeast infection of the penis. Men who take JARDIANCE may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis, especially uncircumcised males and those with chronic infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience redness, itching or swelling of the penis, rash of the penis, foul smelling discharge from the penis, and/or pain in the skin around penis.
Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis is a serious condition and may need to be treated in the hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes taking JARDIANCE, even if blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL.  Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with JARDIANCE. Stop taking JARDIANCE and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms, and if possible, check for ketones in your urine:
nausea
vomiting
stomach-area (abdominal) pain
tiredness
trouble breathing
Kidney problems. Sudden kidney injury has happened in people taking JARDIANCE. Talk to your doctor right away if you reduce the amount you eat or drink, or if you lose liquids; for example, from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long.
Serious urinary tract infections. Serious urinary tract infections can occur in people taking JARDIANCE and may lead to hospitalization. Tell your doctor if you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as a burning feeling when passing urine, a need to urinate often or right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach or pelvis, or blood in the urine. Sometimes people also may have a fever, back pain, nausea or vomiting.
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia): If you take JARDIANCE with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea or insulin may need to be lowered. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include:
headache
drowsiness
weakness
dizziness
confusion
irritability
hunger
fast heartbeat
sweating
shaking or feeling jittery
Necrotizing fasciitis. A rare but serious bacterial infection that causes damage to the tissue under the skin in the area between and around your anus and genitals (perineum). This bacterial infection has happened in women and men who take JARDIANCE, and may lead to hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Seek medical attention immediately if you have fever or are feeling very weak, tired or uncomfortable (malaise), and you develop any of the following symptoms in the area between and around your anus and genitals: pain or tenderness, swelling, and redness of skin (erythema).
Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. Symptoms of serious allergic reactions to JARDIANCE may include:
swelling of your face, lips, throat and other areas of your skin
difficulty with swallowing or breathing
raised, red areas on your skin (hives)

If you have any of these symptoms, stop taking JARDIANCE and contact your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room right away.
Increased fats in your blood (cholesterol).
The most common side effects of JARDIANCE include urinary tract infections and yeast infections in females.

51033,AstraZeneca Presents Results of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in P-lll DAPA-CKD Study for Chronic Kidney Disease at ASN Kidney Week 2020,"Farxiga DAPA-CKD Phase III trial reduced worsening of kidney function, risk of cardiovascular or renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease, irrespective of underlying cause","The P-lll DAPA-CKD study involves the assessing of Farxiga (qd, 10 mg) + SOC vs PBO in 4304 patients with CKD stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with/ out T2D
 Results of subgroup analysis : RRR & ARR (5.8% & 37%) for patients whose CKD was primarily driven by diabetic kidney disease; (25% & 2.2%) for high B.P.; (57% & 7.5%) for glomerulonephritis; (42% & 5.0%) for CKD of other or unknown causes (ARR = 5.0%) respectively. Also showed reduction in in all-cause mortality as secondary outcome
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is a first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy & combination regimen as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and has received FDA’s BTD & CHMP’s recommendation in Oct’2020","A new subgroup analysis from the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial showed that AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin), on top of standard of care, reduced the composite of worsening of kidney function or risk of cardiovascular (CV) or renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), irrespective of the underlying cause of the disease.1

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function.2 It is estimated to affect nearly 700 million people worldwide, many of them still undiagnosed.3-5 One in three adults in the US, or approximately 80 million people, are at risk of developing CKD.5 The main causes of CKD are diabetes (38%), high blood pressure (26%) and glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation, 16%).6

In the subgroup analysis, compared to placebo Farxiga showed a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 37% for patients whose CKD was primarily driven by diabetic kidney disease (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 5.8%); 25% for high blood pressure (ARR = 2.2%); 57% for glomerulonephritis (ARR = 7.5%); and 42% for CKD of other or unknown causes (ARR = 5.0%) (p−interaction for RRR 0.53).1 Similarly, Farxiga showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, a secondary outcome, compared to placebo regardless of underlying CKD cause (p-interaction 0.55).1

The safety and tolerability of Farxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine.

Prof. Hiddo L. Heerspink, co-chair of the DAPA-CKD trial and its Executive Committee, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, said: “These results reinforce the potential of Farxiga to change the standard of care for a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease, regardless of the root cause of the disease. This could open up enormous possibilities for the millions of patients living with chronic kidney disease worldwide.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “The DAPA-CKD trial showed the potential of Farxiga as the first SGLT2 inhibitor to significantly prolong survival in a renal outcomes trial in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type-2 diabetes. The new data presented further demonstrate Farxiga’s consistent and clinically meaningful benefit across a diverse group of patients with chronic kidney disease, a population in urgent need of new treatment options to slow the progression of their disease.”

The data were presented at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week Reimagined 2020.

Earlier this month, Farxiga was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US for patients with CKD, with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D) and was recommended for approval in the EU by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for heart failure (HF). Additionally, in May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D.

Chronic kidney disease

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).2 In its most severe form, known as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.7 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.8

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga was given once daily in addition to standard of care. Detailed results shared in August 2020 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed Farxiga reduced the primary composite endpoint of worsening of renal function (defined as a composite of a sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause) or renal or CV death by 39% compared to placebo (p<0.0001). The results were consistent in patients both with and without T2D. Farxiga also met all secondary endpoints including the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause by 31% (ARR = 2.1%, p=0.0035).9

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hHF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

Farxiga is currently being assessed in patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials, as well as in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

51040,Foundation Medicine's FoundationOne CDx Receives the US FDA's Approval as a CDx for Vitrakvi (larotrectinib),FoundationOne®CDx Receives FDA-Approval as a Companion Diagnostic for VITRAKVI®(larotrectinib) to Identify Patients with NTRK Fusions Across All Solid Tumors,"The US FDA approved FoundationOneCDx to be used as a CDx for Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) to identify patients with NTRK fusions across all solid tumors. The genomic test is currently approved as a CDx for 20+ therapies
 The FoundationOne CDx is the tissue-based CGP test approved to detect NTRK1/2/3 fusions across all solid tumor types and identify patients who may be appropriate for treatment with Vitrakvi
 The approval of Vitrakvi was based on three studies including LOXO-TRK-14001, SCOUT, and NAVIGATE studies and is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Foundation Medicine, Inc. today announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FoundationOne®CDx to be used as a companion diagnostic for VITRAKVI® (larotrectinib), which is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that have a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment. FoundationOne CDx, the only FDA-approved tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test, is now approved to detect NTRK1/2/3 fusions across all solid tumor types and identify patients who may be appropriate for treatment with VITRAKVI.

NTRK fusion positive cancer occurs when a piece of the chromosome containing the NTRK gene breaks off and binds to another chromosome. These NTRK gene fusions produce TRK fusion proteins, which may cause cancer cells to grow.1 NTRK fusions are more commonly found in rare cancer types, such as secretory carcinoma of the breast or salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma, but they can also occur across many more common cancer types including glioma, melanoma and carcinomas of the lung, thyroid and colon.2

“Taking a comprehensive and validated approach to genomic testing is critical for all advanced cancer patients, but especially for those harboring rare mutations that can be missed with alternative testing methods,” said Brian Alexander, M.D., M.P.H., chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine. “Not only will this approval improve access to genomic testing and reinforce the role it plays in rare cancers, but it also confirms the incredible progress made toward tumor-agnostic cancer care. We’re proud of the impact this will have on NTRK fusion positive cancer patients.”

FoundationOne CDx is the first FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic that is clinically and analytically validated for solid tumors. The tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling test is currently approved as a companion diagnostic for more than 20 targeted therapies.

“Many patients with rare conditions, like NTRK fusion positive cancer have limited treatment options and poor access to targeted therapies,” said Susan Spinosa, co-chair and patient founder of the NTRKers. “This companion diagnostic approval is a critical step forward in addressing this challenge as it provides this patient population with broader access to comprehensive genomic testing and appropriate treatment options.”

The approval of VITRAKVI was based on data from three multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trials: LOXO-TRK-14001 (NCT02122913), SCOUT (NCT02637687), and NAVIGATE (NCT02576431). Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next generation sequencing (NGS) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). NTRK gene fusions were inferred in three pediatric patients with infantile fibrosarcoma who had a documented ETV6 translocation by FISH. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and response duration, as determined by a blinded independent review committee according to RECIST 1.1. The clinical validation to support the FoundationOne CDx NTRK companion diagnostic approval was then achieved through a clinical bridging study between the local clinical trial assays and FoundationOne CDx.

51072,"Samsung Bioepis Reports Results of Renflexis (biosimilar, infliximab) from Two Studies in IBD Patients",Samsung Bioepis Announces First Real-World Data on RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) with IBD patients from Veterans Affairs Healthcare System at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2020,"The company reported results from two real-world studies of Renflexis (infliximab-abda) in patients with IBD registered in the US Veteran Affairs Healthcare System database. Data were presented at ACG 2020
 One study assesses the safety of switching from reference infliximab or infliximab-dyyb to Renflexis in patients with IBD identified from the VAHS database and demonstrated an 83% continuation rate over 1yr. with similar continuation rate in patients who underwent a single & double switch from reference infliximab
 Second study focused on the real-world utilization pattern of infliximab products for IBD, within the context of VANF policy. The study found that Renflexis became the preferred infliximab product on VANF in Sept’2018 which was faster than the adoption of the previous biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb), listed on VANF in May’2017","INCHEON, Korea, Oct. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. today announced results from two real-world studies of RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) registered in the U.S. Veteran Affairs Healthcare System database. The data were presented for the first time at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2020 Annual Scientific Meeting, which is held virtually from October 23-28, 2020.

One nationwide study evaluated the safety of switching from reference infliximab or infliximab-dyyb to RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in patients with IBD identified from the VAHS database. Among 298 patients who were switched to RENFLEXIS®, continuation rate was 83% over one year. The study also found that continuation rates were similar between patients who underwent a single switch from reference infliximab to RENFLEXIS® or double switch from reference infliximab to infliximab-dyyb to RENFLEXIS®, reflecting the safety of switching from either reference product or biosimilar.

Nabeel Khan, MD, Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, who led the study said, “since IBD symptoms can be severe, maintaining a stable condition is important for IBD management. This study demonstrated that patients who were on infliximab, reference product or biosimilar, can remain stable after switching to another biosimilar, without major safety concerns.”

Another study looked at real-world utilization pattern of infliximab products for IBD, within the context of Veterans Affairs National Formulary (VANF) Policy. It found that adoption of RENFLEXIS®, which became the preferred infliximab product on VANF in September 2018, was faster than adoption of the previous biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb) that was listed on VANF in May 2017.

“We are confident that this real-world switch data will provide additional reassurance to gastroenterologists who are treating patients with IBD,” said Seongwon Han, Vice President, Medical & Lifecycle Safety Team Leader, at Samsung Bioepis. He continued “together with our partners, we remain committed to demonstrating the value of biosimilars for patients and physicians, as well as payers.”

Both studies are presented as ePosters, which are available on the ACG 2020 Virtual Meeting Platform.

RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2017 as a biosimilar to REMICADE®1 (infliximab). In the United States, RENFLEXIS® is commercialized by Merck, also known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada. In September 2018, it was awarded a national contract from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and is currently the only infliximab option listed on the VA National Formulary (VANF). RENFLEXIS® is currently listed at USD 121.43 (National Contract Price)2 on VANF and is expected to bring cost savings of approximately USD 81 million every year for the Veteran Affairs Healthcare System from 2018 to 2023, if widely adopted.3

About two real-world studies of RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) in IBD patients

Abstract P1597: The safety of switching from originator infliximab or CT-P13 to SB2 among a nationwide cohort of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. Nabeel Khan et al.

For the nationwide retrospective cohort study, a total of 298 patients registered to the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) from Jan 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020 were followed-up for one year after starting treatment with infliximab-abda. Patients who were treated with reference infliximab and/or infliximab-dyyb and maintained stable IBD conditions1 for three months before switching were eligible for the study. The primary outcome observed was the discontinuation rate at one-year, which was 17%. Continuation rates were similar between patients who switched one time (reference infliximab → infliximab-abda) and two times (reference infliximab → infliximab-dyyb → infliximab-abda), at 87% and 82% respectively. 13% of the total patients stopped due to either loss of response, development of antibodies, or a hypersensitivity reaction.

Abstract P1570: Infliximab Biosimilar use for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A National Veterans Affairs Experience. Jessica Johnson et al.

The purpose of the second study was to describe infliximab product selection for Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) during the time frame when biosimilars entered the VA and obtained VANF status. Infliximab products were used in 3,204 Veterans with IBD (60.2% CD, 39.8% UC). Non-formulary use of infliximab occurred in higher percentage of infliximab experienced patients than infliximab-naïve patients. Product selection changed throughout the years, reflecting VANF status: Infliximab was used with the highest frequency in 2016-2017, infliximab-dyyb during 2018, and infliximab-abda during 2019. The time delay between the initial designation as the preferred infliximab product and becoming the most frequently used infliximab product in infliximab-naïve Veterans was five months for infliximab-dyyb and two months for infliximab-abda.

Selected Safety Information about RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda)

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with infliximab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue RENFLEXIS if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent TB before RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) use and during therapy.1,2 Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to RENFLEXIS use.
Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, pneumocystosis, and cryptococcosis. Patients may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.
The risks and benefits of treatment with RENFLEXIS should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RENFLEXIS, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy, who are on treatment for latent TB, or who were previously treated for TB infection.

Risk of infection may be higher in patients greater than 65 years of age, pediatric patients, patients with comorbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In clinical trials, other serious infections observed in patients treated with infliximab products included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, and skin ulceration.

MALIGNANCIES

Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. Approximately half of these cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of malignancies, including rare malignancies that are usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months after the first dose of therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants.

Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treatment with RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda), especially in these patient types.

In clinical trials of all TNF inhibitors, more cases of lymphoma were observed compared with controls and the expected rate in the general population. However, patients with Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or plaque psoriasis may be at higher risk for developing lymphoma. In clinical trials of some TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, more cases of other malignancies were observed compared with controls. The rate of these malignancies among patients treated with infliximab products was similar to that expected in the general population whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with postmarketing TNF-blocker use. As the potential role of TNF inhibitors in the development of malignancies is not known, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with a current or a past history of malignancy or other risk factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocker therapy, including infliximab products. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.

A population-based retrospective cohort study found a 2- to 3-fold increase in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-naïve patients or the general population, particularly those over 60 years of age. A causal relationship between infliximab products and cervical cancer cannot be excluded. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with infliximab products.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe (NYHA Class III/IV) congestive heart failure (CHF) at doses greater than 5 mg/kg. Higher mortality rates at the 10 mg/kg dose and higher rates of cardiovascular events at the 5 mg/kg dose have been observed in these patients. RENFLEXIS should be used with caution and only after consideration of other treatment options. Patients should be monitored closely. Discontinue RENFLEXIS if new or worsening CHF symptoms appear. RENFLEXIS should not be (re)administered to patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction or to patients with hypersensitivity to murine proteins or other components of the product.

HEPATITIS B REACTIVATION

TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, have been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases were fatal. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating RENFLEXIS. For patients who test positive, consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B. Exercise caution when prescribing RENFLEXIS for patients identified as carriers of HBV and monitor closely for active HBV infection during and following termination of therapy with RENFLEXIS. Discontinue RENFLEXIS in patients who develop HBV reactivation and initiate antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. Exercise caution when considering resumption of RENFLEXIS and monitor patients closely.

HEPATOTOXICITY

Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis have been reported rarely in patients receiving infliximab products postmarketing. Some cases were fatal or required liver transplant. Aminotransferase elevations were not noted prior to discovery of liver injury in many cases. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations (e.g., ≥5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, RENFLEXIS should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken.

HEMATOLOGIC EVENTS

Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia (some fatal) have been reported in patients using infliximab products. The causal relationship to infliximab therapy remains unclear. Exercise caution in patients who have ongoing or a history of significant hematologic abnormalities. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of blood dyscrasias or infection. Consider discontinuation of RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) in patients who develop significant hematologic abnormalities.

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that differ in their time of onset and required hospitalization in some cases. Most hypersensitivity reactions, which include anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and hypotension, have occurred during or within 2 hours of infusion. Serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis were infrequent. RENFLEXIS should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions should be available.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIONS DURING AND AFTER INFUSION

Serious cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), hypotension, hypertension, and arrhythmias have been reported during and within 24 hours of initiation of infliximab infusion. Cases of transient visual loss have been reported during or within 2 hours of infusion of infliximab. Monitor patients during infusion and, if a serious reaction occurs, discontinue infusion. Manage reactions according to signs and symptoms.

NEUROLOGIC EVENTS

TNF inhibitors, including infliximab products, have been associated in rare cases with CNS manifestation of systemic vasculitis, seizure, and new onset or exacerbation of CNS demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution when considering RENFLEXIS in patients with these disorders and consider discontinuation if these disorders develop.

AUTOIMMUNITY

Treatment with infliximab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.

USE WITH OTHER DRUGS

Concomitant use of RENFLEXIS with anakinra, abatacept, tocilizumab, or other biologics used to treat the same conditions as RENFLEXIS is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection. Care should be taken when switching from one biologic to another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of infection.

LIVE VACCINES/THERAPEUTIC INFECTIOUS AGENTS

Live vaccines or therapeutic infectious agents should not be given with RENFLEXIS (infliximab-abda) due to the possibility of clinical infections, including disseminated infections. Bring pediatric patients up to date with all vaccinations prior to initiating RENFLEXIS. At least a 6-month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of any live vaccine to infants exposed in utero to infliximab products.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In clinical trials with infliximab products, the most common adverse reactions occurring in >10% of patients treated with infliximab products included infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain.

51079,Sanofi and Regeneron Report Results of Dupixent (dupilumab) in Part A of P-lll Study for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE),Dupixent® (dupilumab) late-breaking pivotal data showing significant improvement in eosinophilic esophagitis signs and symptoms presented for the first time at scientific meetings,"Part A of P-lll study involves assessing of Dupixent (qw, 300mg) vs PBO in 81 patients aged≥ 12 yrs. with EoE. The study resulted in meeting its co-primary and all key 2EPs, presented at the virtual ACG 2020 and UEG Week 2020
 Results: Patients reported significant improvement on DSQ as 4 wks. and continued to improve through 24 wks; reduced EEC (<15) eos/hpf (64% vs 8%) @24wks. Peak EEC (71% vs 3%). ET changes associated with the disease reduced (0.761 and 0.753 vs 0.001 and 0.012) reduction @24wks.; gene expression patterns associated with type 2 inflammation and EoE were reduced (1.97-fold & 2.66-fold vs 0.32-fold & 0.16-fold); SAEs (86% vs 82%)
 Dupixent is mAb inhibiting the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 proteins and has received the US FDA’s BT designation for the treatment of patients ≥12yrs. with EoE","PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – October 26, 2020 – Additional positive results were announced from Part A of a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). As previously reported, the trial met both of its co-primary and all key secondary endpoints. New late-breaking data showing additional improvements in disease severity and extent at the microscopic level, as well as normalization of gene expression pattern associated with type 2 inflammation, were presented at the virtual American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Scientific Meeting and the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week Virtual 2020.

There are currently no FDA-approved medicines for EoE, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. Over time, excessive type 2 inflammation may cause scarring and narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. EoE can affect a patient’s ability to eat and cause food to become stuck after being swallowed (food impaction), which can lead to a medical emergency.

Previously announced results showed Dupixent improved symptomatic, structural and histologic measures of EoE. The use of Dupixent to treat EoE is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

“The results from this trial show dupilumab significantly improved both patients’ ability to swallow as well as structural abnormalities in the esophagus, by targeting type 2 inflammation to help reverse tissue damage and scarring that usually worsens over time,” said Evan S. Dellon, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and principal investigator of the trial. “These results also demonstrate that eosinophilic esophagitis is a disease caused by factors beyond just the presence of elevated eosinophils. Dupilumab, which targets the activity of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 that drive type 2 inflammation, was able to show significant improvements in a broad range of clinical, anatomic, cellular and molecular measures.”

Part A of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 81 patients aged 12 years and older with EoE, who were treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly over a 24-week treatment period or placebo.

New results presented at virtual ACG 2020 and UEG Week 2020 showed patients treated with Dupixent experienced:

Rapid improvement in ability and comfort of swallowing: patients reported significant improvement on the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) as early as 4 weeks and continued to improve through 24 weeks (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively).
Reduced esophageal eosinophil count below the diagnostic disease threshold: 64% of patients treated with Dupixent achieved <15 eosinophils/high-power field (eos/hpf) compared to 8% for placebo at 24 weeks (p<0.001). Peak esophageal eosinophil count was reduced by 71% with Dupixent compared to 3% with placebo from baseline (p<0.001).
Reduced severity and extent of the disease at the microscopic level: the grade and stage scores that measure esophageal tissue changes associated with the disease were reduced by 0.761 and 0.753 with Dupixent compared to a 0.001 and 0.012 reduction for placebo at 24 weeks; the EoE Histology Scoring System (EoE-HSS) grade and stage scores measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on four-point scales, respectively (p<0.001 for all values).
Normalized gene expression in esophageal tissue: gene expression patterns associated with type 2 inflammation and EoE were reduced by 1.97-fold and 2.66-fold, compared to a 0.32-fold and 0.16-fold reduction with placebo, respectively, as measured by the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) at 24 weeks from baseline. The NES evaluated a panel of genes associated with type 2 inflammation or EoE (p<0.001 for all values). The changes observed with Dupixent demonstrate a shift in gene expression pattern from one that resembles EoE disease to a pattern that resembles healthy controls.
The trial demonstrated similar safety results to the well-established safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were 86% for Dupixent and 82% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions (n=15 for Dupixent, n=12 for placebo) and upper respiratory tract infections (n=11 for Dupixent, n=6 for placebo). There was one treatment discontinuation in the Dupixent group due to joint pain.

In September, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs in the U.S. that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Drugs qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that it may demonstrate a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies, or over placebo if there are no available therapies. In 2017, Dupixent also was granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE. This is given to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and in which no adequate medicines have been developed and approved.

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis.

About the Dupixent eosinophilic esophagitis trial

The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis. Part A of the trial enrolled 81 patients (42 treated with Dupixent and 39 with placebo) aged 12 years and older with EoE, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. The co-primary endpoints assessed the change from baseline in the DSQ, a patient-reported measure of difficulty swallowing, and the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, a measure of esophageal inflammation, at 24 weeks. Key secondary endpoints of the trial assessed histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus, as measured by the EoE-HSS grade and stage scores, and the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of <15 eos/hpf at 24 weeks. Other secondary endpoints of the trial assessed NES for the relative change from baseline to week 24 in the EoE diagnostic panel and type 2 inflammation transcriptome signatures. In total, 85% of these patients suffered from at least one concurrent atopic condition such as allergic rhinitis, food allergy and asthma. Patients received weekly subcutaneous injections of Dupixent 300 mg or placebo for the 24-week treatment period.

The EoE trial is ongoing, with additional patients enrolling in Part B as well as patients continuing in a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C) after completing either Part A or Part B. Part B of the trial is evaluating an additional Dupixent dosing regimen.

About Dupixent

Dupixent is approved for adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, asthma and/or in adults with CRSwNP in a number of countries around the world, including the European Union and Japan, as well as the U.S. where Dupixent is also approved for children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is currently approved in more than 60 countries, and more than 190,000 patients have been treated globally.

Dupilumab development program

To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including EoE (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

51089,Novartis Presents Results of Iptacopan (LNP023) in P-ll Study for C3 Glomerulopathy at ASN Annual Meeting 2020,Novartis presents promising interim Phase II data of potential first-in-class oral therapy iptacopan (LNP023) in rare renal disease C3 glomerulopathy (C3G),"The P-II study involves assessing the efficacy, safety and PK of Iptacopan (LNP023) in patients with C3G (Cohort A) and patients who have undergone a kidney transplant and have C3G recurrence (Cohort B), interim results presented at ASN 2020
 Result: @12wks., reduction in proteinuria (49%) as measured by 24hrs. UPCR assessment; improvement in plasma C3 level; inhibit alternative complement pathway activity; stabilized renal function as assessed by eGFR
 Iptacopan (PO) is a first-in-class reversible inhibitor of factor B and has received EMA’s PRIME designation for iptacopan in C3G and EMA’s ODD in IgAN. The therapy is in development for multiple renal conditions including C3G, IgAN, aHUS, iMN as well as in PNH which is a hematological disease","Basel, October 26, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive Phase II interim analysis results for iptacopan (LNP023), an investigational oral treatment for C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), presented at the virtually held American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 Annual Meeting.

Data from the open-label Phase II study (NCT03832114), showed that after 12 weeks, iptacopan significantly reduced proteinuria by 49% compared to baseline values, as measured by 24-hour urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) assessment, in twelve patients with C3G (P=0.0005). Iptacopan strongly inhibited alternative complement pathway activity and improved plasma C3 levels. In addition, iptacopan stabilized renal function as assessed by eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) at week 12 and this effect was maintained in the seven patients that were treated for a total of six months after rolling over into the long-term extension study (NCT03955445)7.

“Proteinuria indicates the presence of inflammation in the kidney. Results from this study demonstrate that iptacopan significantly reduces proteinuria in patients with C3G,” said the lead study investigator, Dr Edwin Wong, Consultant Nephrologist at the National Renal Complement Therapeutics Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle University. “This data also highlights iptacopan’s ability to strongly and specifically inhibit the alternative complement pathway, targeting the underlying cause of this disease and potentially providing a much needed treatment option for C3G patients who have significant unmet needs.”

Iptacopan also had a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this Phase II study with no deaths, no serious adverse events suspected to be related to iptacopan and no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

“Iptacopan is the most advanced asset in our nephrology pipeline.” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “These data demonstrate that it has the potential to improve the lives of patients with C3G.”

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME designation for iptacopan in C3G. PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary program is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. In addition, EMA has also granted an orphan drug designation for iptacopan in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).

About C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)
C3G is an ultra-rare and severe form of primary glomerulonephritis, characterized by complement dysregulation.1,9 It has a worldwide annual incidence of 1–2 per million11 and an approximate prevalence of 10,000 in the US, ~10,500 in Europe, 3,200 in Japan and 32,000 in China12.

C3G is commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. The disease has a poor prognosis; about 50% of patient progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, and 50–70% experience disease recurrence post kidney transplant.2

Currently, there are no approved therapies specifically designed to target the underlying complement dysregulation that occurs in people with C3G. Current standard of care is with non-specific immunosuppressants with limited clinical evidence. Although antihypertensive or immunosuppressive agents and terminal complement pathway blockers are helpful in some patients, no treatment is universally effective or curative. 2,3,9,10 Therefore, novel treatment options are needed to address disease symptoms and slow the progression of C3G.

About iptacopan
Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first-in-class oral, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor B, a key serine protease of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.4,5

In addition to C3G, iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

Novartis is also investigating iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Following positive Phase II data presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August, a randomized, active-comparator controlled open-label Phase III trial (NCT04558918) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 antibody therapy is planned to start in Dec 2020.13

Iptacopan has the potential to become the first alternative complement pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement driven diseases.

About the Study
The study (NCT03832114) is a Phase II, open-label, two cohort, non-randomized study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of iptacopan in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) (Cohort A) and patients who have undergone kidney transplant and have C3G recurrence (Cohort B).14 On completion of the study, patients can roll over into a long-term extension study (NCT03955445).

About Sugemalimab (PD-L1)

Sugemalimab is an investigational anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody discovered by CStone. Authorized by a company based in the U.S., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: LGND), sugemalimab is developed using the OmniRat® transgenic animal platform, which can generate fully human antibodies in one stop. As a fully human, full-length anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, sugemalimab mirrors the natural G-type immunoglobulin 4 (“IgG4”) human antibody, which may reduce the risk of immunogenicity and toxicities in patients, a potentially unique advantage over similar drugs.

Sugemalimab has completed a Phase I dose-escalation study in China. During Phase 1a and 1b stages of the study, sugemalimab showed antitumor activity in multiple tumor types and was well-tolerated.

Currently, sugemalimab is being investigated in a number of ongoing clinical trials. In addition to a Phase I bridging study in the U.S., the clinical programs in China include one multi-arm Phase Ib study for several tumor types, one Phase II registrational study for lymphoma, and four Phase III registrational studies, respectively, for stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. The phase III clinical trial of sugemalimab in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer has reached its primary endpoint. CStone plans to submit a new drug application to the National Medical Products Administration of China soon.

About CS1003 (PD-1)

CS1003 is a humanized recombinant IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting human programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) being developed for immunotherapy of various tumors. Compared to most of the monoclonal antibodies that bind human and monkey PD-1 (either already approved or in clinical stage), CS1003 demonstrates comparable high binding affinities across species against human, cynomolgus monkey and mouse PD-1, and is developed to disrupt the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.

MADISON, Wis. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (“Thrive”), a healthcare company dedicated to incorporating earlier cancer detection into routine medical care, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Exact Sciences will acquire Thrive for cash and stock consideration of up to $2.15 billion. The transaction was unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close during the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of other conditions.

Combining Thrive’s pioneering early-stage screening test, CancerSEEK, with Exact Sciences’ best-in-class scientific platform, clinical organization, and commercial infrastructure will establish Exact Sciences as a leading competitor in blood-based, multi-cancer screening. Thrive, with an early version of CancerSEEK, has conducted a first-of-its-kind 10,000-patient, prospective, interventional study in a real-world clinical setting. In this landmark study, using its mutation and protein biomarker approach, CancerSEEK achieved promising results detecting 10 different types of cancer, including seven with no recommended screening guidelines, with very few false positives. Bringing together highly complementary scientific approaches and the strengths of both organizations, Exact Sciences expects to develop a more accurate test and accelerate the widespread adoption of this potentially life-saving advancement.

“The acquisition of Thrive is a giant leap toward ensuring blood-based, multi-cancer screening becomes a reality and eventually, the standard of care. We couldn’t be more excited that Exact Sciences will be at the forefront of this incredible opportunity to serve patients,” said Kevin Conroy, Chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. “We have long respected the Thrive team for their rigorous scientific approach, having participated in both funding rounds as an investor. We are proud to take our partnership to the next level by leveraging Exact Sciences’ established R&D team and highly accurate testing platform to augment development of CancerSEEK and accelerate its commercialization. By combining the expertise of both organizations, we believe we can bring this powerful technology to patients faster.”

“Thrive is driven by the knowledge that if cancer is caught early enough, it can be more effectively treated or even cured, and every patient deserves a chance for a better outcome,” said David Daly, CEO of Thrive. “Our team has made significant progress toward our mission and we are eager to collaborate with and benefit from Exact Sciences’ expertise, and believe that together we will enable broader, quicker adoption of our test. With the support of our ongoing partnership with Johns Hopkins University, we are energized to contribute meaningfully to our shared mission of advancing the fight against cancer and providing life-changing answers to patients in need.”

Creating a Leader in Blood-Based, Multi-Cancer Screening

Transforming the Future of Cancer Diagnostics with a Premier R&D Team: The Exact Sciences R&D team has robust clinical and evidence generation capabilities. This powerful team will be complemented and enhanced by the addition of Thrive’s R&D groups specializing in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in liquid biopsy. The combined R&D team’s impact will be amplified by Exact Sciences’ database of proprietary biomarkers, extensive blood sample biorepository, financial strength, and each company’s established partnerships with leading institutions, including Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins University.
Accelerating the Approval, Availability, and Adoption of Multi-Cancer Screening: Exact Sciences is uniquely positioned to support the development of Thrive’s CancerSEEK product and facilitate its success. By leveraging Exact Sciences’ proven clinical and regulatory teams, scaled laboratory and IT capabilities, and well-established primary care sales team and direct-to-consumer marketing experience, the Company expects to bring blood-based, multi-cancer screening to patients faster and with greater certainty.
Positioning Exact Sciences as a Leader in a $25 Billion+ Market and Demonstrating Capabilities as a Research and Commercialization Partner-of-Choice: The need to detect the deadliest cancers at earlier, more treatable stages is urgent, and multi-cancer screening can be an impactful solution. Thrive has conducted a large study in a real-world clinical setting, with promising results at a low false positive rate. By joining with Thrive, Exact Sciences would be well-positioned to compete in a significant U.S. market, estimated to be at least $25 billion. Exact Sciences is already home to two of the strongest and fastest-growing brands in cancer diagnostics, Cologuard® and Oncotype DX®. With the addition of Thrive, Exact Sciences would have the scientific rigor necessary to bring tests to patients at every step of their cancer journey, from screening to minimal residual disease, recurrence monitoring, and therapy selection. This rigor and Exact Sciences’ existing commercial strength further distinguish the Company as a leading developer and provider of innovative products across the cancer continuum.

51143,Sanofi Presents Results of Olipudase Alfa in Two Clinical Studies at ASHG 2020,Olipudase alfa demonstrated significant improvement in lung function and spleen volume in patients with ASMD,"The P-II/III ASCEND trial involves assessing olipudase alfa 3 mg/kg (IV, q2w) vs PBO in 36 adult patients with ASMD type B to evaluate treatment impact on pulmonary function & spleen & liver volume for 52wks. The study demonstrated improvement in lung function (22% vs 3%), reduction in spleen volume (39.5% vs 0.5%), reduction in liver volume (31.7% vs 1.4%); improvement in platelet counts (16.8% vs 2.5%)
 The P-II ASCEND-Peds trial involves assessing olipudase alfa 3 mg/kg (IV) q2w for 64 wks, in 20 pediatric patients with ASMD without acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities. The study demonstrated 33% increment in predicted DLCO, reduction in spleen volume & liver volume (49% & 41%); 34% increment in platelet count
 Olipudase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective ASM, allowing for the breakdown of sphingomyelin, currently being investigated to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD. The therapy has received FDA’s BT designation, EMA’s PRIME Designation and MHLW’s SAKIGAKE designation","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. – October 27, 2020– Olipudase alfa, an investigational recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase, demonstrated significant improvement in lung function and spleen volume in patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). Results from two separate clinical trials of adult and pediatric patients were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting this week and will form the basis of global regulatory submissions expected to begin in the second half of 2021.

Historically referred to as Niemann-Pick Disease (NPD) type A and type B, ASMD is a rare, lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which is found in special compartments within cells called lysosomes and is required to breakdown lipids called sphingomyelin. If ASM is absent or not functioning as it should, sphingomyelin cannot be metabolized properly and accumulates within cells, eventually causing cell death and the malfunction of major organ systems. The deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme ASM is due to disease-causing variants in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 gene (SMPD1). The overall global estimated incidence of ASMD is 0.4-0.6 in 100,000 births.i,ii

“ASMD is a progressive and potentially life-threatening genetic disease with no approved treatment options,” said Melissa Wasserstein, MD, Chief, Division of Pediatric Genetic Medicine, Children’s Hospital at Montefiore; Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “Results from both the adult and pediatric clinical trials with olipudase alfa clearly demonstrate the potential of this investigational therapy to impact visceral manifestations of ASMD and have a meaningful impact on the lives of those impacted by this devastating disease.”

Data in Adult Patients with ASMD (ASCEND)

The Phase 2/3 trial randomized 36 adult patients with ASMD type B to receive either placebo or olipudase alfa up to 3 mg/kg administered via intravenous infusion every two weeks for 52 weeksiii to evaluate treatment impact on pulmonary function and spleen and liver volume. An open-label, single-arm extension of this study is ongoing to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of olipudase alfa.

Lung function at 52 weeks:

Olipudase alfa significantly improved lung function by 22% from baseline compared to 3% for patients receiving placebo (p=0.0004), as measured by percent predicted diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO).
Spleen volume and Splenomegaly Related Score (SRS) at 52 weeks:

Olipudase alfa significantly reduced spleen volume by 39.5% compared with a 0.5% increase in the placebo arm (p<0.0001), as assessed by percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN) of spleen volume.
For the US, this was combined with the SRS, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement that evaluated patient symptoms associated with an enlarged spleen. There was no meaningful difference between the treatment and placebo arms (8.0 point decrease for olipudase alfa vs. 9.3 point reduction for placebo; p=0.70); therefore this combination endpoint was not met for the US.
Our analysis of the SRS data did not find a correlation with spleen volume at baseline, nor was the change in SRS correlated with the change in spleen volume at week 52.
Liver volume and platelet count at 52 weeks (pre-specified secondary endpoints):

Olipudase alfa reduced liver volume by 31.7%, compared with a 1.4% decrease in the placebo arm, as measured by percent change from baseline in MN of liver volume.
Mean platelet counts improved by 16.8% in olipudase alfa versus 2.5% in placebo-treated patients.
Overall safety and tolerability profile at 52 weeks:

All patients in the placebo and olipudase alfa arms experienced at least one adverse event (AE). The number of events was lower in the olipudase alfa arm (242 events) compared with the placebo arm (267 events).
Severe AEs were less frequent in the olipudase alfa arm (3 events) compared with the placebo arm (13 events).
There were five serious AEs in the olipudase alfa arm and 11 in the placebo arm, none of which were treatment related. There were no adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal.
Infusion associated reactions were mild to moderate, with 44% of olipudase alfa patients and 33% of placebo patients experiencing infusion-related reactions.
The most common AEs in the trial were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and arthralgia (as defined by percentages of events ≥ 2% and number of olipudase alfa treated patients ≥ 2).
Treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies occurred in 22% of olipudase alfa patients.
“These are powerful data evidenced by statistically significant improvement in lung function and spleen  volume and clinically meaningful reduction in liver volume,” said Karin Knobe, Head of Development of Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders at Sanofi. “The totality of the study data shows olipudase alfa has the potential to provide meaningful improvements to adults who have lived with a debilitating rare disease for decades.”

Data in Pediatric Patients with ASMD (ASCEND-Peds)

This single arm, open label Phase 2 trial of 20 pediatric patients (birth to <18 years) with ASMD  without acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities evaluated the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa up to 3 mg/kg administered intravenously every two weeks for 64 weeks.iv All 20 patients completed the study and continue in an extension trial.

Safety data at 64 weeks:

All patients treated with olipudase alfa in the trial experienced treatment-emergent AEs that were mostly mild or moderate.
Eleven patients had infusion-associated reactions. The most frequent were: urticaria (4 patients), pyrexia (7 patients) and vomiting (6 patients).
Five treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in three patients: two cases of transient, asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase in one patient, one case each of urticaria and rash in one patient, and one anaphylactic reaction in one patient.
No patients had to permanently discontinue treatment due to an adverse event.
The most common AEs  were pyrexia, cough, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, contusion, abdominal pain, nasal congestion, rash, urticaria, scratch, and epistaxis (as defined by percentages of events ≥2% and number of olipudase alfa-treated patients ≥2).
Also presented were 52-week exploratory efficacy results, defined as secondary objectives in the trial, measuring lung function, spleen and liver volume, and patient growth. These results showed improvement in these clinically relevant disease endpoints.

Percent predicted DLCO increased by a mean of 33% (32.9% + 29.1%) in nine patients who were able to perform the test at baseline (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test).
Spleen volume decreased by 49% (49.2% + 9.7%) and liver volume by 41% (40.6% + 9.4%), as assessed by mean MN.
Fifteen patients (78.9%) improved in the Height Z-score category, and four (21.1%) patients remained in the same category.
Platelet count increased 34% (34.0% +36.42%).
About ASMD

ASMD represents a spectrum of disease caused by the same enzymatic deficiency, with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum, sometimes referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A is a rapidly progressive neurological form of the disease resulting in death in early childhood due to CNS complications. ASMD type B, is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease that predominantly, but not only, impacts the lungs, liver, spleen and heart. ASMD type A/B represents an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of neurologic involvement. Patients with ASMD type A/B or ASMD type B were studied in the ASCEND trial program. Another type of NPD is NPD type C, which is unrelated to ASMD.

About olipudase alfa

Olipudase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective ASM, allowing for the breakdown of sphingomyelin. Olipudase alfa is currently being investigated to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD. Olipudase alfa has not been studied in ASMD type A patients.

Olipudase alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide.

The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to olipudase alfa. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. The criteria for granting Breakthrough Therapy designation include preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the molecule may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.

The EMA has awarded PRIority MEdicines, also known as PRIME, designation to olipudase alfa. This designation is designed to aid and expedite the regulatory process for investigational medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options.

Olipudase alfa was awarded the SAKIGAKE designation in Japan. SAKIGAKE is intended to promote research and development in Japan for innovative new medical products that satisfy certain criteria, such as the severity of the intended indication.

51174,Novartis Signs an Option and License Agreement with Molecular Partners to Develop Two DARPin Therapies for COVID-19,Novartis announces collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19,"Molecular Partners to receive $65.8M as up front, including equity, and will receive $164.7M as an option payment for both MP0420 and MP0423 along with royalties on sales of therapies. Novartis to get an option to in-license global rights of MP0420 and MP0423
 During the option period, Molecular Partners will conduct a P-I study for MP0420, expected to initiate in Nov’2020, and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423 while Novartis will lead P-II & P-III study
 Upon option exercise, Novartis will lead further development and commercialization activities while Molecular Partners will provide clinical supply during the development stage. MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines for the prevention & treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility of being manufactured at scale and the potential to bypass cold storage","Basel, October 28, 2020 — Novartis and Molecular Partners AG today announced a collaboration in the form of an option and license agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 DARPin® program, consisting of two therapeutic candidates, MP0420 and MP0423. The collaboration aims to leverage Molecular Partners’ proprietary DARPin® technologies and Novartis broad expertise in global drug development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization to rapidly advance the program in keeping with the unprecedented global urgency created by the pandemic.

Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of those efforts, it has become increasingly clear that to tackle the pandemic at a global level the development of medicines that can prevent and treat the virus, in addition to the development of vaccines, will be crucial. Multiple treatment options increases the likelihood of reaching and treating patients around the world and, in addition, may be especially important for certain populations at greater risk who may benefit from a prophylactic treatment. MP0420 and MP0423 are potential medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, with the possibility of being manufactured at scale and the potential to bypass cold storage.

“Novartis remains unwavering in its support for tackling COVID-19 and it is clear that this pandemic calls for not just scientific solutions, but also for collaboration between companies to provide treatments in an area of high unmet need. This Swiss led partnership, which could deliver both prophylactic and treatment options at scale for COVID-19 patients across the globe, is another demonstration of our sustained commitment to addressing one of the greatest health challenges of our time,” said Vas Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer of Novartis.

Molecular Partners are a Swiss based clinical-stage biotech company that are developing a new class of custom-built protein therapeutics known as DARPin® therapeutics. Under the agreement, during the option period, Molecular Partners will conduct Phase 1 clinical trials for MP0420, expected to begin in November 2020, and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423 and Novartis will conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of these trials. Upon option exercise, Novartis would be responsible for all further development and commercialization activities. During the clinical development stage, Molecular Partners will provide clinical supply. The companies will work together to scale-up manufacturing capacity, in collaboration with Sandoz, the generics and biosimilar Novartis division, to provide worldwide supply.

Several characteristics of DARPin® therapeutics make them ideally suited for antiviral therapy including multi-specific target binding with the potential to prevent viral escape via mutations, the possibility for subcutaneous administration, long half-life for sustained activity, the potential to bypass cold storage and typically high-yield, highly scalable production in bacterial fermenters. These factors provide the possibility of developing and manufacturing this innovation at scale. This supports the commitment of both companies to leverage their respective strengths and expertise to urgently develop these two potential treatments and if the data are positive, facilitate access to these medicines for patients around the world as quickly as possible.

“Our team rapidly mobilized to deliver a unique DARPin®-based approach to address the overwhelming need for effective therapeutics against COVID-19. As a class, DARPins have demonstrated over years of clinical research a number of characteristics that enhance their profile as antiviral therapeutics for a global pandemic. We have built on this long-term research with these two candidates, which have demonstrated extremely potent neutralization of the virus through inhibiting multiple viral mechanisms,” said Patrick Amstutz, Chief Executive Officer of Molecular Partners. “We are thrilled to partner with Novartis, who has shown great commitment to combatting this pandemic and bringing innovative solutions to people around the world.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Molecular Partners will receive an upfront payment of CHF 60 million, including equity.

Molecular Partners will receive a further payment of CHF 150 million, upon Novartis electing to take up the option to both therapeutic candidates, and significant royalty on sales. Molecular Partners has agreed to forgo royalties in lower income countries, and is aligned with Novartis’ plans to ensure affordability based on countries’ needs and capabilities.

Novartis response to COVID-19 Pandemic
Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis has been active in two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). The company is also separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia patients. Novartis also announced a collaboration with the African Union (AU) through the Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP) to facilitate the supply of medicines from the Novartis Pandemic Response Portfolio to the AU member states and Caricom countries. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID.

51192,AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receive NMPA's Approval for Label Update to Include Data of P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 Study,Forxiga cardiovascular outcomes benefit approved in China,"The updated label includes P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 study that assesses the effect of Forxiga vs PBO on CV outcomes in 17000+ patients with T2D at risk of CV events also assessed key renal 2EPs, across 882 sites in 33 countries
 The study demonstrated that Forxiga achieved a significant reduction in the composite EP of hHF or CV death. The trial confirmed the well-established safety profile of Forxiga
 The NMPA’s label update follows the update to the EU MAA in Aug’2019 and the US FDA’s approval granted in Oct’2019","Update to approval includes DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III trial that reduced the risk of composite of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death in type-2 diabetes
China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has updated the label for AstraZeneca’s Forxiga (dapagliflozin) to include data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III trial.

DECLARE-TIMI 58 demonstrated that Forxiga achieved a statistically significant reduction in the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death, versus placebo, in adults with type-2 diabetes (T2D) and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. The trial confirmed the well-established safety profile of Forxiga.1

DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor CV outcomes trial conducted to date, and data from the trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January 2019.

There are an estimated 463 million people living with diabetes worldwide, with nearly 120 million in China.2 Patients with T2D are two to five times more likely to develop chronic heart failure (HF) than those without T2D.3

Ruud Dobber, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit, said: “Heart failure is one of the first cardiovascular complications for patients with type-2 diabetes. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III data show that Forxiga reduces the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and, with this label update, we look forward to bringing this significant benefit to patients in China.”

Forxiga is indicated as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapies to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D. The NMPA label update, based on the DECLARE-TIMI 58 Phase III data, follows the update to the EU marketing authorisation in August 2019 and the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019 of an indication for Forxiga (known as Farxiga in the US) to reduce the risk of hHF in adults with T2D and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors.

In May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hHF in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D, and in October 2020 Forxiga was recommended for approval for HF in the EU by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Additionally, the FDA granted Farxiga Breakthrough Therapy Designation in October 2020 to accelerate the development and regulatory review for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without T2D.

Type-2 diabetes

T2D is a chronic disease characterised by pathophysiologic defects leading to elevated glucose levels, or hyperglycaemia.2 Over time, this sustained hyperglycaemia contributes to further progression of the disease.2 The prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 578 million people worldwide by 2030, and 700 million by 2045.2 T2D accounts for approximately 90-95 percent of all cases of diagnosed diabetes.4

DECLARE-TIMI 58

DECLARE-TIMI 58 is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial designed to evaluate the effect of Forxiga compared with placebo on CV outcomes in adults with T2D at risk of CV events, including patients with multiple CV risk factors or established CV disease, and also assessed key renal secondary endpoints. The trial included more than 17,000 patients across 882 sites in 33 countries and was independently run in collaboration with academic investigators from the TIMI study group (Boston, US) and the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel).1

Forxiga

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction.

Forxiga has been evaluated in patients with CKD in the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial, with the full results announced in August 2020 demonstrating that Forxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints, providing overwhelming efficacy. Forxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) Phase III trials. Forxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Forxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

51239,Lilly Reports Results of Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in P-II BLAZE-1 Study in New England Journal of Medicine,Data for Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in COVID-19 outpatients published in New England Journal of Medicine,"The P-II BLAZE-1 study assesses bamlanivimab (700, 2800 & 7000 mg) vs PBO in the outpatient setting in patients with mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than 3 days prior to drug infusion
 Results: The study showed that bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in patients recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19
 LY-CoV555 is a neutralizing IgG1 mAb directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 & designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing & treating COVID-19","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The New England Journal of Medicine has published data from the monotherapy arms of BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study assessing the efficacy and safety of Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) – a neutralizing antibody – in the COVID-19 outpatient setting. This study focused on ambulatory COVID-19 patients being treated in the outpatient setting, whose symptoms did not require hospitalization at the time of enrollment. The publication, which can be found here, follows Lilly’s proof-of-concept data announcement for bamlanivimab as monotherapy in September 2020.

“The publication of these data in a peer-reviewed journal adds to the growing body of evidence for the potential utility for neutralizing antibodies as therapeutics for people recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19, particularly high-risk patients,” said Ajay Nirula, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology at Lilly and co-first author of the study. “These data show bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in outpatients.”

“It is important to treat people with COVID-19 as soon as possible after diagnosis in order to forestall development of more severe disease,” said Peter Chen, M.D., director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-first author of the study. “Our findings indicate that neutralizing antibodies may have the potential to be useful in this early-stage intervention.”

These data were submitted as part of Lilly’s request for an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for bamlanivimab in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19.

About BLAZE-1

BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with a second antibody for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo.

The primary outcome measure for the completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll over 800 participants.

Data from the BLAZE-1 study show bamlanivimab may be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalization in patients recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19. In the BLAZE-1 trial, rates and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity and with no drug-related serious adverse events reported thus far. In other bamlanivimab studies, there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, both patients recovered).

About bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555)

LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study of ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

51289,Boehringer Ingelheim Initiates P-II Study of BI 764198 for Patients with Severe Respiratory Illness from COVID-19,Boehringer Ingelheim Begins Phase 2 Clinical Trial of a Targeted Therapy to Help People with Severe Respiratory Illness from COVID-19,"The P-II trial will assess BI 764198 (qd for ~4wks.) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with expected enrollment initiation in Oct’2020. The 1EPs will be the percentage of patients who are alive and free of mechanical ventilation at day 29 of treatment while other EPs include clinical improvement, oxygen saturation & ICU admission
 The therapy has shown a reduction in cellular damage and lung edema in preclinical studies and may provide similar benefits in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. BI 764198 was well tolerated in P-I study in healthy adults
 BI 764198 is potent & selective inhibitor of TRPC6, focusing to reduce the need for ventilator support and to improve patient recovery rate","Ingelheim, Germany – 28. October 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of BI 764198, an inhibitor of TRPC6, a receptor-operated cation channel.  This potent and selective inhibitor of TRPC6 may alleviate the damage to the lung and decrease the risk or severity of acute respiratory complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The aim of therapy with BI 764198 is to reduce the need for ventilator support, to improve patient recovery rate and ultimately to save lives. Boehringer Ingelheim is committed to fighting COVID-19 and contributing with its expertise and resources to develop new therapeutic options for patients suffering from the virus’ severe complications.

“COVID-19 can cause serious lung complications, such as viral pneumonia, and in severe cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lung failure,” said Dr. Lorraine B. Ware, Ralph and Lulu Oven Endowed Chair and Professor of Medicine, and Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University. “Patients hospitalized with ARDS due to COVID-19 are often unable to breathe on their own and may require life support from a mechanical ventilator to help supply oxygen to the body. While we hope that future vaccines will help reduce cases of severe COVID-19, there remains an unmet need to address respiratory complications in infected patients, and provide healthcare professionals an effective alternative to mechanical ventilation that can potentially reduce the treatment burden within the hospital setting.”

Approximately 15% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease and up to 30% of severely ill patients may require medical care in an intensive care unit (ICU). Between 67 and 85 percent of patients in the ICU develop ARDS, a potentially deadly complication of severe COVID-19.1 Therapeutic options, such as BI 764198, are urgently needed to reduce severe respiratory distress, save lives and ultimately help reduce the incredible burden the virus is placing on healthcare systems.

“This therapy may provide the first potential treatment for COVID-19 related respiratory distress syndrome, helping to close a significant gap in the treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients. As we have understood more in recent months about the pathology of this disease, we realized that BI 764198 might have a unique potential to help the most severely affected  patients and we felt compelled to bring it to clinical studies,” said Dr. Mehdi Shahidi, Corporate Senior Vice President Medicine and Chief Medical Officer, Boehringer Ingelheim. “It is our hope that this step forward will provide treating physicians with a new tool to improve the outlook for their hospitalized patients affected by the respiratory complications of COVID-19.”

As a research-driven company, Boehringer Ingelheim is part of the collective effort in fighting COVID-19. Drawing from their areas of expertise, the company has engaged in a number of activities to find medical solutions to this pandemic, working closely with academic researchers, international institutions, and others in the pharma industry. Boehringer Ingelheim is currently involved in a broad set of initiatives to fight the disease and save patients’ lives, including the research and development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that can neutralize the virus, small molecules to inhibit its replication, and therapy development to prevent microcoagulation (blood clots). Boehringer Ingelheim is also an active participant in the global access initiative with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as global development initiatives including the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator (CTA) and the CARE Consortium.

About the Study
This Phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial will evaluate BI 764198 in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with participants taking one capsule per day for up to four weeks. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients who are alive and free of mechanical ventilation at day 29 of treatment. Other endpoints include clinical improvement, oxygen saturation and ICU admission. In patients hospitalized for COVID-19, there is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to airway injury. ROS have been shown to activate TRPC6, which may cause a cascade of cellular damage resulting in disruption of cellular barrier function, hyper-permeability, edema and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). BI 764198 treatment in animal models of lung injury has been shown to reduce cellular damage and lung edema. Treatment with BI 764198 may provide similar benefits in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. BI 764198 has been shown to be well tolerated in a previous Phase 1 study in healthy adults (NCT03854552).

Trial enrollment for BI 764198 is expected to begin in October 2020 and will include approximately 40 study sites across eight countries. For more information, please visit: clinicaltrials.gov and mystudywindow.com.

51367,Roche's Tecentriq in Combination with Avastin Receives China NMPA's Approval for the Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with Avastin approved in China for people with the most common form of liver cancer,"The approval was based on the P-III IMbrave150 study (n=501) assessing the combination of Tecentriq (1200 mg, IV) and Avastin (15 mg/kg, IV) or sorafenib (400 mg, bid) in unresectable HCC patients who had not received prior systemic therapy which included analyses of a cohort of Chinese patients (n=194) from the same study
 Results: Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of OS by 56% (among Chinese patients) and 42% (global results) & the PFS risk by 40% (among Chinese patients) and 41% (global results) as compared with sorafenib
 IMbrave150 is the 1st P-III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable or metastatic HCC compared with sorafenib. Additionally. in May 2020, the US FDA approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy","Basel, 29 October 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) for the treatment of people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

“Today’s approval of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma means that people in China now have a cancer immunotherapy option which is changing the treatment landscape for this aggressive disease”, said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With almost half of the world’s hepatocellular carcinoma cases diagnosed in China, this approval marks a major advance for Chinese patients.”

“In China, primary liver cancer ranks as the fourth most common malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death. With most patients diagnosed at the intermediate and advanced stages where surgery or other locoregional therapies are not an option, there is an urgent need for effective treatments for unresectable HCC”, said Prof. Shukui Qin, Leading Principal Investigator of the IMbrave150 study in China and Chairman of the Liver Cancer Expert Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO). “The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin in this setting can significantly improve outcomes for patients. It is truly gratifying news that the combination is now approved in China and gives a new option to Chinese liver cancer patients.”

Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in China, accounting for nearly 400,000 diagnoses and approximately 368,000 deaths every year, equivalent to over 1,000 per day.1 Only 20% of people with HCC in China are diagnosed in the early stages, when curative treatments are still an option.2 The average 5-year survival rate for people in China with liver cancer is only approximately 15%.3 Roche is committed to tackling liver disease right across the disease journey, from the earliest stages through to advanced disease, with the ultimate goal of one day stopping chronic liver disease.

The approval was based on results of the Phase III IMbrave150 study, which included analyses of a cohort of Chinese patients (n=194) from the same study. Data from this cohort were consistent with the global results. Among Chinese patients, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (overall survival; OS) by 56% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.44; 95% CI: 0.25–0.76) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 40% (HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.40–0.90), compared with sorafenib. Tecentriq and Avastin were generally well-tolerated with manageable toxicities, and the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines and with the underlying disease.

Global results from the IMbrave150 study demonstrated that Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (OS) by 42% (HR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47–0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib. IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable or metastatic HCC compared with sorafenib. Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 57% of people receiving Tecentriq and Avastin and 55% of people receiving sorafenib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and fever. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 14 May 2020.4 

In May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, in September, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy. Tecentriq in combination with Avastin was also recently recommended as a preferred option by the CSCO for the treatment of unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally.

Earlier this year, the China NMPA also approved Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) for the first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), an area of major unmet need and one that has seen limited advances in treatment until now. The submission was based on the results from the positive Phase III IMpower133 study and was the first cancer immunotherapy available in China for the initial treatment of ES-SCLC.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, multicentre, open-label study of 501 people with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy. People were randomised 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq was administered intravenously (IV), 1200 mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Avastin was administered IV, 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered by mouth, 400 mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. People received the combination or the control arm treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The two primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Additional study endpoints included IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST.

About hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC, the most common form of liver cancer, is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide.5 Every year, more than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC,5,6 with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China.1,6 In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise.7-9 HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage.5 The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.10

About the Tecentriq and Avastin combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, China and a number of other countries, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for a type of liver cancer.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

51374,AstraZenca Reports Results of Fasenra (benralizumab) in P-lllb PONENTE Trial for Asthma,Fasenra eliminated oral corticosteroid use in a majority of OCS-dependent patients with asthma in PONENTE Phase IIIb trial,"It is based on P-lllb PONENTE trial assessing Fasenra (benralizumab, 30mg) in adult patients with severe Asthma on high-dose ICS + LABA and long-term use of OCS therapy with or without additional asthma controller. This study included approx. 600 patients in EU, North America, South America, and Taiwan
 Results: 62% of patients achieved complete elimination of daily OCS use on 1EP and on the 2EP, 81% of patients achieved complete elimination or were able to reduce their daily OCS dose to 5mg or less when further reduction was not possible due to adrenal insufficiency
 Fasenra is mAb that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis. It is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries","High-level results from the PONENTE Phase IIIb open-label trial showed Fasenra (benralizumab) eliminated the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) in OCS-dependent asthma patients with a broad range of blood eosinophil counts.

Severe asthma is an often debilitating condition affecting approximately 34 million people worldwide.1,2 More than one-third of these patients currently use chronic or intermittent OCS on top of other therapies to control their symptoms and exacerbations.3,4 However, frequent or chronic OCS use can lead to serious adverse effects.5-7

On the first primary endpoint, 62% of patients achieved complete elimination of daily OCS use. On the second primary endpoint, 81% of patients achieved complete elimination or were able to reduce their daily OCS dose to 5mg or less when further reduction was not possible due to adrenal insufficiency. Both primary endpoints were sustained for at least four weeks while maintaining asthma control. PONENTE included nearly 600 patients in Europe, North America, South America, and Taiwan.

Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow, Director of the Lung Division, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK, the principal investigator of the PONENTE trial, said: “These exciting results demonstrate Fasenra’s impact in eliminating or reducing oral corticosteroid use. The reductions achieved with the personalised oral corticosteroid tapering schedule are particularly important because adrenal insufficiency can be a barrier to safe and meaningful oral corticosteroid reduction. These data should inform severe asthma treatment guidelines and strengthen physicians’ confidence to more safely eliminate chronic oral corticosteroid use in their patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Around 13.5 million people worldwide with severe asthma currently rely on oral corticosteroids to control exacerbations and prevent hospitalisations. However, over-reliance on oral corticosteroids can also cause significant health risks for patients, as well as additional strain on health systems. These data further support Fasenra’s clinical profile in eliminating oral corticosteroid use across a broader population of severe asthma patients.”

The trial expands on OCS-sparing data previously seen in the ZONDA Phase III trial by using a faster steroid tapering schedule in patients who did not experience adrenal insufficiency to reduce OCS use from higher doses. The PONENTE trial also has a longer maintenance phase of approximately 24–32 weeks, which shows more durable OCS reduction and asthma control than was shown in ZONDA and all other published trials for biologic medicines.8,9 The safety profile and tolerability of Fasenra in PONENTE were consistent with the known profile of the medicine. The trial results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries, and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries. In January 2020, AstraZeneca announced Fasenra is being evaluated in eight eosinophil-driven diseases beyond severe asthma.

Severe asthma

Asthma affects approximately 339 million individuals worldwide.1,2 Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, which may be uncontrolled despite high dosages of standard of care asthma controller medicines and can require the long-term use of OCS.2,10,11 Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating and potentially fatal, with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations and significant limitations on lung function and health-related quality of life.2,11,12 Severe, uncontrolled asthma has a greater risk of mortality than severe asthma.10 70% or more of people with severe asthma have elevated counts of eosinophils, white blood cells that are a normal part of the immune system and can drive airway inflammation in some patients.10,11,13,14

Severe, uncontrolled asthma can lead to a dependence on OCS, with cumulative steroid exposure leading to serious short- and long-term adverse effects including weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, glaucoma, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease immunosuppression and adrenal insufficiency.5-7 OCS over-reliance can also place additional strain on health systems; a UK analysis identified OCS-dependent asthma patients have an average of 43% greater associated direct healthcare treatment costs than patients not receiving maintenance OCS.15

Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones.16,17 Steroid hormones are important to help control metabolism, inflammation, immune functions and salt and water balance, among other critical functions.17 Adrenal insufficiency can develop as a result of taking chronic OCS and may persist following steroid reduction or discontinuation, potentially causing serious clinical consequences including shock, seizure, coma and even death in cases of an acute adrenal crisis.16,17

PONENTE

PONENTE is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, Phase IIIb trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reducing daily OCS use after initiation of 30 mg dose of Fasenra administered subcutaneously (SC) in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and long-term use of OCS therapy with or without additional asthma controller(s). Patients recruited into the study had been on maintenance OCS dose of ≥5 mg of prednisone for at least three months and had a baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/μL or baseline eosinophils below 150 cells/μL with a documented eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/μL in the past 12 months. The treatment period consisted of a four-week induction phase with no OCS adjustments, a variable OCS tapering phase and an ongoing 24-32-week maintenance phase.8,18

The primary outcome measures of the trial were the proportion of patients achieving a 100% reduction in daily OCS dose and the proportion of patients achieving a 100% reduction or a daily OCS dose of ≤5 mg if the reason for no further OCS reduction was adrenal insufficiency, both sustained for at least four weeks without worsening of asthma.8,18

Compared to published trials, PONENTE has a personalised OCS tapering schedule that allows for more rapid OCS tapering from high OCS doses, followed by an assessment of the adrenal function as part of decision-making to manage the risk of adrenal insufficiency. PONENTE also has a significantly longer maintenance phase, (approximately 24-32 weeks versus four weeks for published trials of other biologics) allowing assessment of the durability of OCS reduction.8,18

Fasenra

Fasenra (benralizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).19,20

Fasenra is in development for other eosinophilic diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.21-25 The Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in 2018, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis in 2019.

Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

51381,Sanofi Entered into an Agreement with Merck to Conduct a P-II Study of THOR-707 in Sequenced Administration with MSD's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Patients with Various Cancers,Sanofi to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel investigational candidate THOR-707 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in pursuit of establishing a new treatment option in oncology,"Sanofi will sponsor the clinical trials while MSD will provide KEYTRUDA. Additionally, Sanofi is separately evaluating the activity of THOR-707 in combination with other anti-PD-1 antibodies, including Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) and with anti-EGFR and anti-CD38 antibodies for various types of cancer tumors
 In preclinical studies, THOR-707 demonstrated the ability to induce the expansion of CD8+T-cells resulting in anti-tumor effects both as a single agent as well as in combination with an anti-PD1 mAb
 THOR-707 is currently being evaluated by Sanofi in an ongoing P-I dose escalation and expansion trial assessing THOR-707 and determining its recommended P-II dose alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-EGFR antibodies","PARIS – October 29, 2020 – Sanofi has entered into an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of THOR-707, a highly differentiated non-alpha IL-2 candidate with a best-in-class profile, combined with or in sequenced administration with MSD’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with various cancers.

Under the agreement, Sanofi will sponsor the clinical trials while MSD will provide KEYTRUDA.

“We believe that THOR-707 has the potential to become a foundation of the next generation of immuno-oncology therapies,” said Peter Adamson, Global Head, Oncology Development and Pediatric Innovation, Sanofi. “This collaboration with MSD will enable us to explore whether THOR-707 can increase and expand the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA and improve the outcomes for patients with cancer.”

THOR-707 is currently being evaluated by Sanofi in an ongoing Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion trial.  This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of THOR-707, and to determine its recommended Phase 2 dose alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-EGFR antibodies.

In addition to testing THOR-707 in combination with KEYTRUDA, Sanofi is separately evaluating the activity of this novel biologic in combination with other anti-PD-1 antibodies, including Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and with anti-EGFR and anti-CD38 antibodies for various types of cancer tumors.

THOR-707 demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to induce the expansion of CD8+T-cells resulting in anti-tumor effects both as single agent as well as in combination with an anti-PD1 mAb.

It is the first molecule from the Synthorin platform, Sanofi’s unique expanded genetic alphabet platform, which has the potential to create a new generation of precision medicines for oncology and autoimmune disease.

About THOR-707

THOR-707 has the potential to be a best-in-class IL-2 therapeutic for the treatment of many types of malignancies and may demonstrate improved pharmacology allowing for less frequent dosing. In pre-clinical experiments, THOR-707 shows striking synergy with anti-PD-1 therapeutics.

It is a precisely PEGylated engineered version of interleukin-2 (IL-2), where the PEG chain is attached at a location on IL-2 that prevents it from binding to immune receptors that cause drug toxicities (IL-2R-alpha, CD25) while preserving binding to immune receptors that selectively expand tumor-killing T effector and Natural Killer (NK) cells without the immunosuppressive effects of regulatory T cells or vascular leak syndrome (VLS) inducing eosinophils.

Editor’s Note: As discussed at Sanofi’s R&D Day in June, full Phase 1 results for THOR-707 and the recommended Phase 2 dose are expected by 2021.

51398,AbbVie Reports Results of SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in P-III LIMMitless Study in Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,New Data Show SKYRIZI [® ]▼ (risankizumab) Maintains Completely Clear Skin for Over Three Years in Nearly Two-Thirds of Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"The P-III LIMMitless study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety & efficacy assessing risankizumab (150 mg q12wks.) continuous risankizumab with a loading dose in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The analysis includes integrated data from five P-II & III studies (ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, SustaIMM, IMMvent and NCT03255382) and the LIMMitless study
 Results: ~63% of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with SKYRIZI achieved completely clear skin for 172 wks., as measured by 100% improvement from baseline in the PASI 100. New results from the P-III LIMMitless study were presented at the 29th EADV Virtual Congress
 Risankizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. It is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim & AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development & commercialisation globally","MAIDENHEAD, UK, OCTOBER 29, 2020 – AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with SKYRIZI®▼ achieved completely clear skin for over 3 years (172 weeks), as measured by 100 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100).1 Additionally, after more than 3 years of treatment with risankizumab, 88 percent of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin, as measured by a static Physician’s Global Assessment of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) or a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90).1 No new safety signals were noted through more than 3 years of continuous treatment.1 New results from the Phase 3 open-label extension (OLE) study, LIMMitless, were presented at the 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Virtual Congress, October 29-31.
A separate analysis of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores from the LIMMitless study showed that risankizumab had a substantially positive impact on health-related quality of life.2 DLQI is a measure of a patient’s health-related quality of life, ranging from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating the disease has less impact on life quality.4 After continuous treatment with risankizumab for more than 3 years, the majority of patients (85 percent) achieved a DLQI score of 0 or 1, indicating a significant improvement in quality of life.2 Additionally, after more than 3 years (172 weeks), approximately 91 percent of patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in DLQI scores (at least a 4 point reduction from baseline).2 The proportion of patients achieving this reduction remained consistent from one year (week 52; n=873) to over 3 years (week 172; n=505).2

Integrated safety results across psoriasis studies also being presented show that risankizumab’s safety profile remained consistent over the long-term, with no new safety signals identified up to 5.5 years with continuous treatment with SKYRIZI.3 The latest data was from a separate study that evaluated the short-term (16 weeks) and long-term (up to 5.5 years) safety of risankizumab in data pooled from 17 Phase 1-3 studies.3 This analysis was the largest reporting of safety data for risankizumab to date, including more than 3,000 patients with over 7,900 patient years (PY) of exposure from the psoriasis clinical trial programme.3

“Long-term, complete skin clearance is now a realistic treatment goal, and the data being presented at EADV reinforce that,” said Belinda Byrne, AbbVie UK Medical Director. “It is encouraging to see that patients who were continuously treated with risankizumab were able to improve their quality of life over the long-term.”

“People with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis want treatment options that help them achieve and maintain clear skin so they can return to a better quality of life,” said Kim Papp, M.D., Ph.D., founder and president, Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, Ontario. “Alleviating the burden of living with psoriasis is a critical focus for the scientific community. It is wonderful and exciting to see new research showing how risankizumab has helped make this happen.”

Risankizumab is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialisation globally.

About risankizumab in the European Union5

Risankizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Important EU Safety Information5

Risankizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

▼Adverse events should be reported. Reporting forms and information can be found at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. Adverse events should also be reported to AbbVie on UK_PVVendor@abbvie.com. With biological medicines, healthcare professionals should report adverse reactions by brand name and batch number.

51407,GSK's Zejula (niraparib) Receives EC's Approval as a Treatment in Advanced Ovarian Cancer,European Commission approves Zejula (niraparib) as first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment in advanced ovarian cancer,"The approval is based on PRIMA study assessing Zejula (300mg qd), later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of Zejula (200 mg or 300 mg, qd) based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count
 Results: The PRIMA study improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula reduced the risk of disease progression or death vs. pbo by 57% and the risk of disease progression or death vs. pbo by 38% in the overall population. Additionally, risk of progression in those with BRCA mutation tumours showed 60% reduction
 Zejula is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. It is the first PARP inhibitor approved as monotherapy in the EU for patients with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer","GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) plc today announced the European Commission has approved Zejula (niraparib), an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy. This approval makes Zejula the only PARP inhibitor approved in the European Union for use as a monotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of their biomarker status.

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Over 65,000 women in Europe are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.[i] This approval of Zejula means that many more women will have the option to receive this innovative medicine earlier, potentially extending the time they may spend without their devastating cancer progressing.”

In April 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Zejula in the United States for the same indication, which is supported by data from the pivotal phase 3 PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012) that demonstrated a clinically meaningful progression-free survival benefit of Zejula in the first-line maintenance setting. The PRIMA study enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who responded to first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, a population with high unmet needs and limited treatment options.

Dr Antonio Gonzalez-Martin, Co-Director, Department of Medical Oncology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain, and Primary Investigator for PRIMA, said: “Until now, only women with BRCA-mutant (BRCAm) ovarian cancer, representing just 20% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, were eligible to be treated with a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting.[ii] Expanding the potential use of Zejula, regardless of biomarker status, is an important step forward in treating this challenging cancer.”

The primary endpoint in the PRIMA study was progression free survival analysed sequentially, first in the homologous recombination deficient (HRd) population, then in the overall population. The PRIMA study significantly improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula resulted in a 57% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.59; p<0.0001) and a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo in the overall population (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p<0.001). In addition, there was a 60% reduction in risk of progression in those with BRCA mutation tumours (HR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.62; p<0.001).

Zejula’s safety profile, as demonstrated by the PRIMA results, was consistent with the previously observed clinical safety profile. At initiation of the PRIMA study, patients received a fixed starting dose of 300 mg of Zejula once-daily. The study was later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of either 200 mg or 300 mg of Zejula once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count. Lower rates of grade 3 and 4 haematologic treatment-emergent adverse events were observed with an individualised starting dose, compared to the overall population, including thrombocytopenia (21% compared to 39%), anaemia (23% compared to 31%) and neutropenia (15% compared to 21%).

Based on these results, the Zejula EU prescribing information has been updated to include the individualised starting dose once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count.

Clara MacKay, Chief Executive Officer, World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, said: “Having a new first-line maintenance option for patients with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer in Europe — regardless of BRCA mutation status — speaks to the important role of PARP inhibitors in the fight against ovarian cancer. We are especially delighted that today’s approval means that more women in Europe who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have this new treatment option. We appreciate the commitment and scientific leadership required to develop innovative new therapies that address unmet needs in women’s cancer.”

About Ovarian Cancer

In Europe, ovarian cancer is the sixth deadliest cancer among women[iii] and more than 65,000 women are diagnosed each year.i Despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line, approximately 85% of women with advanced ovarian cancer will see their disease return.[iv] With each recurrence, the time a woman may spend without her cancer progressing gets shorter.

About Zejula (niraparib)

Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. GSK is building a robust niraparib clinical development programme by assessing activity across multiple tumour types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. The ongoing development programme for niraparib includes several combination studies.

GSK in Oncology

GSK is focused on maximising patient survival through transformational medicines. GSK’s pipeline is focused on immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics and synthetic lethality. Our goal is to achieve a sustainable flow of new treatments based on a diversified portfolio of investigational medicines utilising modalities such as small molecules, antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and cell therapy, either alone or in combination.

Important Information for ZEJULA

Zejula approved indication:

Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

Important Safety Information

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to niraparib or to any of the excipients and breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions: Test complete blood counts (CBC) weekly for the first month of treatment, followed by monthly monitoring for the next 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time. This is recommended to monitor for clinically significant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment. If a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia including pancytopenia) that does not resolve within 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. Patients with lower body weight or lower baseline platelet count may be at increased risk of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia. Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the thrombocyte count should be used with caution. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while being prescribed Zejula, treatment should be discontinued, and the patient treated appropriately. Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula. Pre‑existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Zejula should be discontinued in case of hypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy. There have been reports of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving Zejula. In case of PRES, it is recommended to discontinue treatment. Patients with galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. Tartrazine may cause allergic reactions. Paediatric safety and efficacy has not yet been established.

Undesirable effects: The most common serious adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia.

Very common (≥1/10): anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, platelet count decreased, neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypertension, asthenia, dizziness, neutrophil count decreased, cough, arthralgia, back pain, white blood cell count decreased, and hot flush.

Common (≥1/1000 to <1/10): bronchitis, conjunctivitis, leukopenia, hypersensitivity, hypokalemia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, tachycardia, hypertension, epistaxis, dry mouth, abdominal distension, mucosal inflammation (including mucositis), stomatitis, photosensitivity, rash, myalgia, oedema peripheral, fatigue, asthenia, Gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, ALT increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased and weight decreased.

(66.8% vs 29.6%); PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 response rates were maintained through 1year with both q4w & q8w; skin clearance rates increased in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab @24wks., with response rates @56wks. comparable to patients treated with bimekizumab throughout the study
 Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized IgG1 mAb that selectively inhibits both IL-17A & IL-17F","BRUSSELS, Oct. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced the detailed results of the head-to-head Phase 3 BE SURE study, which demonstrated that patients treated with investigational IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor bimekizumab achieved superior skin clearance, as compared to adalimumab, in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.1 These findings were presented for the first time as an oral presentation at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress, taking place virtually between October 29-31, 2020.

BE SURE met all primary and secondary ranked endpoints.1 The co-primary endpoints were at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clear or almost clear (IGA 0/1) versus adalimumab at week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 at weeks 24 and 56, and PASI 100 at weeks 16 and 24.

In BE SURE, patients treated with bimekizumab achieved significantly higher PASI 90, IGA 0/1 and PASI 100 skin clearance rates compared to patients treated with adalimumab at week 16.1 In patients that started bimekizumab at baseline, response rates were maintained up to a year. Rapid increases in skin clearance rates were seen in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab at week 24.1 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab have not been established, and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide.

“In BE SURE, we saw significantly higher skin clearance rates with bimekizumab compared with one of the most commonly used biologic treatments in psoriasis. The study results also demonstrated the potential benefits of switching patients who are being treated with adalimumab to bimekizumab,” said study investigator, Professor Richard Warren, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and The University of Manchester, United Kingdom.

“These findings from BE SURE, the third positive study in the psoriasis clinical development program, are further evidence of bimekizumab’s superior depth of response. The results also add to the mounting evidence supporting the potential value of selective inhibition of IL-17F, in addition to IL-17A, for rapid, complete and durable skin clearance, if approved by health authorities. UCB is proud to be developing innovative solutions for psoriasis patients,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

In BE SURE, 86.2 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved almost clear skin (PASI 90), compared with 47.2 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at week 16 (p<0.001).1 Additionally, 85.3 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved IGA 0/1, versus 57.2 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at week 16 (p<0.001).1 Significantly more patients treated with bimekizumab achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) than those treated with adalimumab: 60.8 percent versus 23.9 percent at week 16, and 66.8 percent versus 29.6 percent at week 24 (p<0.001 for each comparison).1

In the two bimekizumab study arms, PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 response rates were maintained through to week 56.1 These results were observed across both dosing regimens: bimekizumab every four weeks (Q4W dosing) until week 56, or Q4W dosing for 16 weeks, followed by bimekizumab every eight weeks (Q8W dosing) from week 16 to week 56.1 In patients treated with adalimumab, response rates for PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 rapidly increased after patients were switched to bimekizumab Q4W dosing at week 24, through to week 56.1 At week 56, response rates in switched patients were comparable to those who had been treated with bimekizumab throughout the study.1

Through weeks 0–24, the active comparator period, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs were comparable for patients receiving bimekizumab (71.5 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively) and adalimumab (69.8 percent and 3.1 percent).1 Through weeks 0–56, 81.4 percent and 5.1 percent of patients receiving bimekizumab (including those who switched from adalimumab) experienced TEAEs and serious TEAEs, respectively.1 The most common TEAEs that were observed for bimekizumab through weeks 0–56 were nasopharyngitis (20.9 percent), oral candidiasis (16.2 percent) and upper respiratory tract infection (9.0 percent).1 Through week 56, there were no suicidal ideation/behavior, inflammatory bowel disease, or major adverse cardiac events reported in patients treated with bimekizumab.1

BE SURE is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab to adalimumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The active-controlled initial treatment period of 24 weeks is followed by a dose-blind maintenance treatment period until week 56. BE SURE enrolled 478 participants with chronic plaque psoriasis for at least six months prior to screening and with an affected body surface area of at least 10 percent, PASI of at least 12 and IGA score equal to or greater than three on a five-point scale.2

The co-primary endpoints of the study were PASI 90 response (defined as a patient who achieves a 90 percent improvement in PASI) and IGA response (defined as clear or almost clear with at least a two-category improvement relative to baseline) at week 16.

About Bimekizumab
Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.3 IL-17F has overlapping biology with IL-17A and drives inflammation independently to IL-17A.4,5,6,7,8 Selective inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A suppresses inflammation to a greater extent than IL-17A inhibition alone.7,8 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab are being evaluated across multiple disease states as part of a robust clinical program.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory disease with primary involvement of the skin. This skin condition affects men and women of all ages and ethnicities.9 Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary but may include red patches of skin covered with silvery scales; dry, cracked skin that may bleed; and thickened, pitted or ridged nails.10

Psoriasis affects nearly three percent of the population, or about 125 million people worldwide.6 Unmet needs remain in the treatment of psoriasis. A population-based survey identified that approximately 30 percent of psoriasis patients reported that their primary goals of therapy, including keeping symptoms under control, reducing itching and decreasing flaking, were not met with their current treatment.11 Psoriasis has a considerable psychological and quality of life impact, potentially affecting work, recreation, relationships, sexual functioning, family and social life.12

 Garetosmab is a VelocImmune-derived mAb that binds and neutralizes Activin A, which is involved in the development of heterotopic bone in people with FOP","Regeneron today notified clinical investigators to pause dosing of the investigational therapy
garetosmab (REGN2477) in the ongoing Phase 2 LUMINA-1 trial in patients with the ultra-rare
genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The decision was based on
reports of fatal serious adverse events in the trial during the open-label extension, during
which all patients received active treatment. These deaths are being further investigated to
understand if they are related to garetosmab treatment. During the 28-week double-blind
treatment period, there were no deaths in the trial.
Regeneron also shared this update with the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee
and regulatory authorities, and will conduct a review of the trial data to date, to better
understand the benefit/risk profile of garetosmab in people with FOP. Regeneron announced
topline 28-week results from the 44-patient LUMINA-1 trial earlier this year; this is the only
active trial evaluating garetosmab.
About Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a relentless, progressive, ultra-rare genetic
disorder in which muscles, tendons and ligaments are progressively replaced by bone, a
process known as heterotopic ossification (HO). There are believe to be approximately 900
patients diagnosed with FOP worldwide. HO of the jaw, spine, hip and rib cage can make it
difficult to speak, eat, walk or breathe, leading to weight loss and escalating loss of mobility
and skeletal deformity. Most people with FOP are wheelchair bound by 30 years old and the
median age of survival is approximately 56 years. Death often results from complications, such
as pneumonia, heart failure and aspiration stemming from HO and loss of mobility in the chest,
neck and jaw.

51464,Medtronic Expands ENT Portfolio with the Acquisition of Ai Biomed and the Approval of NIM Vital Nerve Monitoring System,Medtronic Expands ENT Portfolio with FDA Clearance of NIM Vital™ Next Generation Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring System and Acquisiton of Ai Biomed Corp.,"Medtronic has expanded its portfolio of technologies focusing on improving the safety of head and neck surgeries with the acquisition of Ai Biomed and the US FDA’s 510(k) clearance of NIM Vital nerve monitoring system
 The NIM Vital nerve monitoring system enables physicians to identify, confirm, and monitor nerve function to help reduce the risk of nerve damage during head and neck surgery
 The acquisition marks the 7th acquisition by Medtronic in 2020. The acquisition will add the PTeye laser system to Medtronic’s ENT portfolio which a tissue-detecting probe used in thyroid surgery","DUBLIN, Oct. 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of the NIM Vital™ nerve monitoring system, which enables physicians to identify, confirm, and monitor nerve function to help reduce the risk of nerve damage during head and neck surgery.1 The NIM Vital system uses proprietary technology to provide detailed intraoperative nerve condition data that informs surgical strategy,2 increases operative efficiency and precision,3 and helps protect patients’ quality of life.4

The company also announced further enhancement of its ENT portfolio with the recent acquisition of privately-held Ai Biomed Corp., maker of the PTeye™ parathyroid detection system. The only probe-based technology of its kind,5 the PTeye system is designed to help confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the physician during thyroid surgery.

“Protecting critical structures during surgery has evolved to an extensive system that brings crucial information to the surgeon’s hands and eyes,” said Gregory Randolph, M.D., professor of Otolaryngology, Claire and John Bertucci endowed chair in Thyroid Surgical Oncology at Harvard Medical School and surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. “There are things we can’t do with our eyes and our hands. Both the NIM Vital and PTeye systems empower surgeons to improve their procedures, and Medtronic continues to provide these types of important operative solutions.”

“The addition of these two technologies builds on our 20-year legacy of providing innovative solutions that assist surgeons during critical head and neck procedures,” said Vince Racano, vice president and general manager of the ENT business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “By offering these complementary technologies – the NIM Vital system to protect crucial nerves and the PTeye system to help confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the surgeon – we’re helping physicians address two of the most common challenges during these procedures.”

About the NIM Vital Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring System
Even with detailed knowledge of anatomy and surgical skill, motor nerves can sometimes be difficult to identify during surgery due to disease, a previous operation, or normal anatomical variations.6,7 Clinical evidence demonstrates the benefits of intraoperative nerve monitoring for nerve preservation and as a risk-minimizing tool.2,3,8

The NIM Vital system enables surgeons to locate and identify nerves, monitor and control manipulation effects, and confirm nerve integrity prior to completing the surgery. Proprietary technology provides real-time feedback on nerve function during intermittent or continuous monitoring so surgeons can adjust course as needed. A large touch-screen and streamlined interface provide an intuitive, guided workflow with enhanced visualization.9 Now available in the United States, the NIM Vital system is also CE marked for distribution outside the U.S.

About the Ai Biomed Corp. Acquisition and the PTeye System
The acquisition of Ai Biomed Corp. expands upon intraoperative technology like the NIM Vital platform and supports the Medtronic goal of using innovative technologies to improve head and neck surgery. The PTeye system helps confirm parathyroid tissue identified visually by the physician, which is a crucial step in thyroid surgery.

The most common type of thyroid surgery involves partial or full removal of the thyroid glands. During thyroid procedures, it is important for surgeons to identify and preserve parathyroid tissue so that it is not inadvertently removed, which may result in hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels. Hypocalcemia can cause numbness in fingers and toes, muscle cramps in legs and feet, irritability, and seizures.10

The acquisition of Ai Biomed Corp. is the seventh in a series of tuck-in acquisitions that Medtronic has made in calendar year 2020. The revenue and earnings contribution is expected to be immaterial to the Medtronic ENT business in the first year and accretive thereafter. In addition, this transaction is expected to meet Medtronic’s long-term financial metrics for acquisitions. Additional terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. The Ai Biomed Corp. facility in Santa Barbara, Calif., and its employees joined Medtronic ENT as part of the acquisition.

51471,Sun Pharma Reports Five Year Results of Ilumya (tildrakizumab-asmn) in P-III Studies for Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis,Sun Pharma Announces 5-Year Sustained Efficacy and Safety Results for ILUMYA® (tildrakizumab-asmn) in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"The P-III extension studies (reSURFACE 1 & reSURFACE 2) involves assessing Ilumya (100 & 200mg) vs PBO in moderate-to-severe PsO participants with at least 50% improvement in PASI 50 at base study completion who received Ilumya within 12wks. of base study end (52 or 64wks.) were eligible to enroll in the extension study & continued on the same Ilumya dose vs PBO (q12w)
 Results: Ilumya (100 mg) @244wks., PASI 90 & PASI 100 (65.9% & 32.8%); PASI75 (88.7%). In long-term analyses, absolute PASI <1/<3/<5 scores @28wks. (50.8%, 85.1% & 96.4%, respectively) were sustained @244wks. (47.7%, 78.8% & 88.7%) respectively. Additional data results presented provide insight into the positive long-term safety profile for Ilumya in five year
 Ilumya is a humanized lgG1/k mAb, targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 & inhibit its interaction with the IL-23 receptor and is approved in Australia, Japan & EU for PsO","MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, “Sun Pharma” including its subsidiaries and/or associate companies) today announced that one of its wholly owned subsidiaries presented positive, five-year Phase 3 data for ILUMYA® (tildrakizumab-asmn) from the combined reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 extension studies. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who continued to receive ILUMYA through five years of continuous treatment maintained consistent and extensive skin clearance with no new safety issues reported.1 These data were presented for the first time at the 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Virtual Congress.

“These results are important as we now have five-year data reinforcing our understanding that ILUMYA may provide patients with sustained skin clearance and a well understood safety profile that was comparable to placebo,” said Richard Langley, M.D., FRCPC, professor of medicine and director of research, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University. “ILUMYA is a valued option for patients in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and these findings are reassuring for physicians and their patients living with this chronic disease.”

In an analysis of the pooled reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 extension studies, patients received ILUMYA 100 mg or 200 mg through five years of continuous treatment. ILUMYA 100 mg is approved in the U.S., Japan and Australia, and 200 mg is additionally approved under the brand name ILUMETRI™ in Europe. In patients who were treated with ILUMYA 100 mg, clear or almost clear skin (PASI 90) was achieved by 65.9% of patients and 32.8% of patients achieved completely clear skin (PASI 100) at Week 244. The standard goal of treatment, a PASI 75 response, was achieved by 88.7% of patients at Week 244.1 The long-term analyses also showed absolute PASI <1/<3/<5 scores at Week 28 (50.8%, 85.1% and 96.4%, respectively) were sustained through Week 244 (47.7%, 78.8% and 88.7%, respectively).1 Absolute PASI scores can provide an indication of the extent of residual disease after treatment. Achievement of an absolute PASI score of <3 has been proposed as comparable to a PASI 90 response, which is equivalent to clear or almost clear skin.3

ILUMYA 100 mg was well-tolerated during the Phase 3 trials. The three adverse reactions that occurred more frequently than placebo and ≥1% in clinical trials were upper respiratory infections (14% vs. 12%), injection site reactions (3% vs. 2%) and diarrhea (2% vs. 1%). Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated similar exposure-adjusted incidence rates of malignancies throughout five years of study. A majority of malignancies were singular events with similar incidence rates as seen in the general US population.2

“These impressive results show that ILUMYA keeps working year-on-year, maintaining a high level of skin clearance and a durable safety profile regardless of baseline level of skin disease, age or background illnesses,” said Abhay Gandhi, CEO, Sun Pharma, North America. “Patients living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis need therapies they can use over long periods of time without loss of efficacy, and we are pleased these data show that ILUMYA is a sustainable choice for patients over the long term.”

ILUMYA is approved for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and is being evaluated for other possible uses. See ongoing studies below for more information.

About the reSURFACE Extension Studies

The Phase 3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2) were randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, three-part studies designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of ILUMYA 100 mg and 200 mg in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. Participants with at least 50 percent improvement in PASI 50 at base study completion who received ILUMYA within 12 weeks of base study end (week 52 or 64) were eligible to enroll in the extension study and continued on the same ILUMYA dose or placebo once every 12 weeks. Researchers evaluated PASI and PGA response (score of 0 or 1 with ≥2 grade reduction from baseline) and incidence rates for prespecified adverse events, including severe infections, cardiovascular events and drug-related hypersensitivities.

About ILUMYA (tildrakizumab-asmn)

ILUMYA (tildrakizumab-asmn) is a humanized lgG1/k monoclonal antibody designed to selectively bind to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and inhibit its interaction with the IL-23 receptor, leading to inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ILUMYA is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, in the United States. ILUMYA has also been approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Australia and Japan, and under the brand name ILUMETRI in Europe.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

ILUMYA is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tildrakizumab or to any other excipients.

Cases of angioedema and urticaria occurred in ILUMYA-treated subjects in clinical trial. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ILUMYA immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.

ILUMYA may increase the risk of infection. Treatment with ILUMYA should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to prescribing ILUMYA in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Instruct patients receiving ILUMYA to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection, or is not responding to standard therapy, closely monitor and discontinue ILUMYA until the infection resolves.

Evaluate patients for TB infection prior to initiating treatment with ILUMYA. Do not administer ILUMYA to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering ILUMYA. Consider antiTB therapy prior to initiation of ILUMYA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving ILUMYA should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after ILUMYA treatment.

Prior to initiating therapy with ILUMYA, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Patients treated with ILUMYA should not receive live vaccines.

Most common (≥1%) adverse reactions associated with ILUMYA include upper respiratory infections, injection site reactions, and diarrhea. Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% but greater than 0.1% in the ILUMYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group included dizziness and pain in extremity.

51480,Novartis Reports Results of Aimovig (erenumab) in P-lV Study for Episodic and Chronic Migraine,Novartis announces positive results from a Phase IV study showing superior tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig® (erenumab) compared with topiramate in migraine prevention,"The P-IV HER-MES study involves assessing Aimovig (erenumab 70mg and 140mg) vs topiramate in 777 patients in a ratio (1:1) with episodic or chronic migraine (≥4 migraine days/month) prior not treated with migraine prevention treatment or previously failed up to three prophylactic migraine treatments
 The study met its 1EPs & 2EPs and had superior tolerability against topiramate, with a higher proportion of patients remaining on Aimovig than on topiramate. The therapy showed superior efficacy, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in their MMDs
 Aimovig is the first EMA, Swissmedic, and US FDA’s approved migraine prevention treatment designed to target CGRP-R","Basel, November 2, 2020 — Novartis announced today that HER-MES, the first Phase IV, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, head-to-head study of Aimovig® (erenumab) against topiramate, an anticonvulsant, in patients with episodic and chronic migraine met its primary and secondary endpoints. The results of HER-MES showed that Aimovig had a superior tolerability and efficacy profile than topiramate, with less discontinuation over the course of the 24-week treatment phase. Aimovig also showed superior efficacy, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days (MMDs).

“The data generated by this first of a kind head-to-head study reinforces the value of erenumab as a safe and effective migraine prevention treatment. The findings also provide novel insights into migraine therapy for physicians and patients,” said Prof. Uwe Reuter, Managing Medical Director at Charité Universitätsmedizin.

“With Aimovig continuing to be the anti-CGRP treatment with the longest safety and efficacy experience, these results further emphasize its potential to provide significant relief from migraine with an infrequent dosing compared with the oral treatment,” said Estelle Vester-Blokland, Global Head Neuroscience Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis remains fiercely committed to reimagining migraine care worldwide, contributing to the improvement of life for people living with this highly debilitating neurological disease.”

HER-MES aimed to determine the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg compared with topiramate, an anticonvulsant commonly used as standard of care in migraine prevention, in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The study enrolled 777 adult patients suffering from ≥ 4 MMDs and who were naïve to, not suitable for or had previously failed up to three prophylactic migraine treatments.

The primary outcome of HER-MES explored the Aimovig treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study. Overall, Aimovig showed superior tolerability against topiramate, with a higher proportion of patients remaining on Aimovig than on topiramate.

The secondary endpoint looked into the superiority of Aimovig compared with topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in MMDs to baseline in the last three months of the 24-week, double-blind treatment phase. A higher number of patients in the Aimovig treatment arm experienced a significant (≥50%) reduction in MMDs compared with those on topiramate treatment arm. The safety profile in the HER-MES study was generally consistent with those seen in previous Aimovig clinical trials.

Additional findings and detailed results of primary and secondary endpoints from this trial will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.

Migraine is a highly debilitating disease that has a significant impact on people’s lives, including time spent with family and friends, or at work2,3. Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine preventive treatment that targets the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R). It is self-administered once monthly via the SureClick® autoinjector, does not require a loading dose and is easy to use4.

Aimovig is the only CGRP-R inhibitor with up to 5-year clinical trial data in episodic and chronic migraine, adding to the breadth of data showcasing the expanded long-term safety and efficacy of the treatment for migraine patients.

About HER-MES
HER-MES (NCT03828539) is a two-armed, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, Phase IV study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of Aimovig® (erenumab) versus topiramate in a patient-centered setting5. The primary endpoint was treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events compared with topiramate during the double-blind treatment phase of the study5. The secondary endpoint was efficacy of 70 mg and 140 mg erenumab versus topiramate in terms of at least 50% reduction in monthly migraine days to baseline in the last three months (months 4, 5 and 6) of the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase5 in the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg daily). The HER-MES study enrolled 777 adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine (≥4 migraine days per month) who had not previously received migraine prevention treatment or had unsuccessfully discontinued up to three previous therapies with propranolol/metoprolol, amitriptyline and flunarizine5. After a 2-week screening and 4-week baseline phase, patients were randomized 1:1 to erenumab or topiramate. In the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase, patients in the erenumab arm received either 70 mg or 140 mg directly after the baseline phase according to the current expert information, as estimated by the investigator5. An increase in dose from 70 mg to 140 mg was possible at any time during the study. Patients in the topiramate arm were given topiramate at the highest tolerated dose (50-100 mg), starting with a 6-week titration phase, according to the latest expert information5. The HER-MES study has been fully developed in Germany. The study was conducted in 82 centers from the end of February 2019 to the end of July 2020.

About Aimovig® (erenumab)
Aimovig is the first European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved migraine prevention treatment designed specifically to block the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), which plays a critical role in migraine. Aimovig has been studied in several large, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its safety and efficacy in migraine prevention. More than 3,000 patients have participated in our overall clinical trial program. This includes 2,600 participants across the four placebo-controlled pivotal Phase II and Phase III clinical studies as well as participants in further studies such as LIBERTY, a dedicated study in a difficult-to-treat treatment failure population. The most common side effects in the clinical program to date have been viral upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. Aimovig is the most prescribed anti-CGRP worldwide, with more than 480,000 patients prescribed in the post-trial setting.

Novartis and Amgen are co-commercializing Aimovig in the US. Amgen has exclusive commercialization rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has exclusive rights to commercialize in the rest of the world.

About Migraine
Migraine is a distinct neurological disease6. It involves recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe head pain that is typically pulsating, often unilateral and associated with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, sound and odors7. Migraine is associated with personal pain, disability, reduced quality of life and financial cost to society8. It has a profound and limiting impact on an individual’s abilities to carry out everyday tasks; the World Health Organization reported migraine to be one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability for men and women8,9. It remains under-recognized and under-treated8,10.

51486,Sanofi to Acquire Kiadis for ~$358M,"Sanofi offers to acquire Kiadis, a clinical-stage company developing cell-based immunotherapy products","Sanofi to acquire all outstanding shares of Kiadis for $6.34/ share, representing an equity value of $358.76M. The offer price represents a premium of 272% over the closing price on Oct 30, 2020, a premium of ~247% over the 30 trading days VWAP and a premium of ~200% over the 90 trading days VWAP
 The transaction is expected to be completed in H1’21. The addition of Kiadis’ NK cell platform and pipeline of cell-based cancer immune-therapeutics & infectious disease therapies complements Sanofi’s existing therapeutic expertise
 In July’2020, Sanofi licensed Kiadis’ pre-clinical K-NK004 program for MM. Sanofi’s infrastructure and capabilities will be leveraged to advance the development of Kiadis’ pipeline","PARIS and AMSTERDAM – November 2, 2020 – Sanofi and Kiadis, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative ‘off the shelf’ natural killer (NK) cell based medicines for the treatment of life-threatening diseases, entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will make a public offer (subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions) to acquire the entire share capital of Kiadis for EUR 5.45 per share, representing an aggregate adjusted equity value of €308m1.

“We believe the Kiadis ‘off the shelf’ K-NK cell technology platform will have broad application against liquid and solid tumors, and create synergies with Sanofi’s emerging immuno-oncology pipeline, providing opportunities for us to pursue potential best-in-disease approaches,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development at Sanofi.

“Kiadis’ vision is to bring novel cell-based medicines to people with life-threatening diseases, and this transaction will help achieve that vision,” said Arthur Lahr, Chief Executive Officer of Kiadis. “After the discontinuation of our lead product candidate and subsequent reorganization in 2019, we restarted Kiadis in 2020 as an entirely new company focused solely on the proprietary and differentiated NK-cell platform that we obtained through the acquisition of Cytosen Therapeutics. Sanofi’s offer is a clear testimony to the uniqueness of our NK-cell platform and the rapid success of Kiadis’ transformation. The Kiadis Boards unanimously believe that Sanofi has the resources and financial strength to accelerate development of our NK-cell products, to the benefit of patients. We believe this transaction represents compelling value to shareholders and offers a fair reflection of the potential of our platform and pipeline, given the risk/reward profile typical to biotech and the capital required to execute our business plan. Finally, this transaction will provide excellent career opportunities for our employees, who will be viewed by Sanofi as their internal cell-therapy experts.”

Innovative K-NK cell platform

Kiadis’ proprietary platform is based on allogeneic or ‘off-the-shelf’ NK cells from a healthy donor. NK cells seek and identify malignant cancer cells and have broad application across various tumor types. The platform has the potential to make products rapidly and economically available for a broad patient population across a wide range of indications.

Kiadis’ NK cell-based medicines will be developed alone and in combination with Sanofi’s existing platforms.

Complementary strong science to generate first-in-class medicines and strategic fit across core therapeutic areas

Sanofi’s research, development, and commercial expertise will be leveraged to advance Kiadis’ pipeline, which includes NK cell based medicines for the treatment of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, liquid and solid tumors, as well as infectious disease.

In July 2020, Sanofi licensed Kiadis’ pre-clinical K-NK004 program for potential combination for multiple myeloma.

Kiadis’ pipeline of NK cell therapies includes:

K-NK002 is in a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating NK cells to prevent post-transplant relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. The Phase 2 trial will be conducted in collaboration with premier U.S. transplant centers.

K-NK003 is a Phase 1 study evaluating NK cells for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

KNK-ID-101 is a program evaluating the properties of K-NK cells and their suitability to fight SARS-CoV-2 and the option to develop K-NK cells as a post-exposure pre-emptive therapy for COVID-19 in high risk patients. Kiadis plans to initiate a phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating use of K-NK cells to treat COVID-19 patients with government grant funding.

Accelerates the clinical development and broadens patient reach of current Kiadis pipeline

Subject to the completion of the public offer, Sanofi will provide the resources and capabilities necessary to accelerate the development of current Kiadis programs for the treatment of blood tumors, solid cancers, and infectious diseases, maximizing their potential to the benefit of patients.

 Results demonstrated non-inferior efficacy of PP6M to PP3M on the 1EPs of time to relapse at the end of the 12mos. period in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis sets, the safety profile is consistent with no new safety signals
 If approved, PP6M will be the first and only long-acting injectable schizophrenia treatment with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. Additionally, Janssen plans to submit an MAA extension to the EMA for PP6M in the coming months","TITUSVILLE, N.J., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) today announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for paliperidone palmitate 6-month (PP6M) for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. If approved, PP6M will be the first and only long-acting injectable (LAI) schizophrenia medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen.

“Janssen’s roots in neuroscience began with research and development of novel therapeutic options for schizophrenia, and this filing builds on that 60-year commitment,” said Bill Martin, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Neuroscience, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We designed this unique dosing regimen so people with schizophrenia and their healthcare teams can focus less on medication intervals and more on other aspects of their treatment plans, such as psychosocial interventions. We look forward to working with the FDA to add a 6-month formulation to our family of paliperidone palmitate products.”

The submission is based on the Route 6 Study, a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority Phase 3 global study that enrolled 702 adults living with schizophrenia from 20 countries. Data showed non-inferior efficacy of PP6M compared to paliperidone palmitate 3-month (PP3M) on the primary endpoint of time to relapse at the end of the 12-month period in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis sets.1 The safety profile observed for PP6M was consistent with previous studies of paliperidone palmitate 1-month (PP1M) and 3-month (PP3M) formulations with no new safety signals emerging.

“Antipsychotic medication plays an important role in schizophrenia symptom control; however, nonadherence to prescribed medicines has been recognized as a problem worldwide,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Addressing this challenging aspect of treatment has been the catalyst for our research and development of long-acting injectable medications for people living with schizophrenia.”

PP6M is intended to be used only after patients have been stabilized on a shorter acting formulation of paliperidone palmitate (PP1M or PP3M), with the goal of administering fewer injections. The Janssen U.S. portfolio of LAI medicines currently approved to treat adults with schizophrenia includes RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone 2-weekly)2, INVEGA SUSTENNA®3 and INVEGA TRINZA®4 (PP1M and PP3M formulations, respectively), all of which are administered in a clinical setting by a medical professional.

Janssen plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application extension to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for PP6M in the coming months.

INDICATIONS
INVEGA TRINZA® (3-month paliperidone palmitate) is a prescription medicine given by injection every 3 months by a healthcare professional and used to treat schizophrenia.

About the Route 6 Trial
The Route 6 Study was a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority global Phase 3 study of 702 adults with schizophrenia, designed to demonstrate that injection of PP6M is not less effective than PP3M for the prevention of relapse in participants previously stabilized on corresponding doses of PP1M or PP3M.

The study consisted of three phases: a screening phase (up to 28 days), a maintenance phase (of 1 or 3 months), and a double-blind phase (of 12 months). Additional/conditional phases included a transition phase and maintenance phase. The maintenance phase was used to stabilize patients on PP1M or PP3M prior to the double-blind phase. Study evaluations included efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety. The study’s duration varied from approximately 13 months to 19 months.

About Long-Acting Injectables
Long-acting injectables (LAIs) allow for the slow release of medicine into the blood and have been available for more than 50 years.5 LAI antipsychotics offer a number of advantages compared with oral medication, including not having to remember to take drugs daily, improved patient outcomes, improved patient and physician satisfaction, and lower relapse rates.6 Based on clinical guidance developed by the American Association of Community Psychiatrists and research evidence from the National Institute for Mental Health and others, the National Council of Behavioral Health recommends LAIs as a first-line treatment to eligible patients.7

About Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe brain disorder affecting approximately 20 million people worldwide8 and an estimated 2.8 million people in the U.S.9,10 The disease is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behavior leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.8

Antipsychotic medication is recognized as an essential component in the treatment of schizophrenia, and adherence to medication plays a critical role in preventing symptoms and costly relapses.11 However, nearly 75 percent of patients with schizophrenia experience a relapse, often driven by non-adherence to prescribed medication.12,13

 The study demonstrated benefits in oral reading recognition (+2.80), picture vocabulary (+5.79), cognition crystallized composite score (+5.29), benefits were maintained up to 12wks. and was well tolerated
 BPN14770 is a novel therapy that selectively inhibits PDE4D to increase the levels of cAMP. In preclinical trials, it promotes the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with FXS and has received the US FDA’s ODD as well as approved for investigational use in the US","GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Tetra Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shionogi & Co. Ltd., today announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 exploratory study in adult patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The study evaluated its lead candidate, BPN14770, a first-in-class phosphodiesterase‐4D (PDE4D) allosteric inhibitor. In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study, BPN14770 demonstrated excellent safety as well as benefits on cognitive function and behavior in 30 patients with FXS.

BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase‐4D (PDE4D). In preclinical studies, BPN14770 promoted the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with FXS, the most common genetic form of Autism.

“We are very excited about the results of this study,” said Mark Gurney PhD, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tetra. “In addition to being safe and well tolerated, treatment with BPN14770 led to significant cognitive improvement, specifically in the language domains, and we also saw a clinically meaningful benefit in overall daily functioning. These findings validate our approach to treating this disease through a mechanism that addresses a core deficit in the disorder. On behalf of the entire Tetra team, I want to sincerely thank the patients, families and investigators who participated in this study as well as the FRAXA Research Foundation, for their assistance in this study.”

The Phase 2 clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study. Each period was 12 weeks in duration with no washout between periods. The study enrolled 30 adult male subjects age 18-41 years with FXS due to >200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Subjects received daily oral doses of 25 mg twice a day of BPN14770 or placebo. Parents/caregivers and physician raters were blinded to treatment. Study enrollment occurred between July 9, 2018 and July 31, 2020. All subjects completed both treatment periods, although carryover effects limited the primary statistical analysis to Period 1. The following results, therefore, describe the outcomes for patients who received BPN14770 during Period 1, compared to those who received placebo.

Cognitive assessments using the NIH-Toolbox revealed significant benefit in Oral Reading Recognition (LSMean Difference +2.80, p=0.0157), Picture Vocabulary (+5.79, p=0.0342), and Cognition Crystallized Composite Score (+5.29, p=0.0018). Parent/Caregiver ratings using 100 point Visual Analog Scales revealed benefit that was judged to be clinically significant in Language (LSMean Difference +14.04, p=0.0051) and Daily Functioning (+14.53, p=0.0017). The benefit of BPN14770 was maintained up to 12 weeks after the crossover from drug to placebo. BPN14770 was very well tolerated in the Phase 2 trial with few adverse events.

“These results offer hope for Fragile X Syndrome patients and their parents” said Dr. Elizabeth Berry-Kravis, pediatric neurologist, Rush University Medical Center, and principal investigator. “The preponderance of clinical outcome measures were in favor of the drug. These included performance-based as well as parent and physician-rated scales which suggests a meaningful impact on the global FXS disease process. I find it exciting that we have a drug that potentially addresses a core deficit in FXS, a decrease in cAMP, that has been documented in patients as well as in the fly and mouse models of the disorder.”

About the Phase 2 Trial

The Phase 2 clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in 30 adult male patients with FXS, ages 18-45, to assess the safety and efficacy of BPN14770. The study was conducted at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois by principal investigator Elizabeth M. Berry-Kravis, M.D., Ph.D. with financial support from the FRAXA Research Foundation. Additional information is available through clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03569631).

About BPN14770

BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) to increase the levels of cAMP, a key signaling molecule, in brain. In preclinical models, BPN14770 promotes the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with Fragile X Syndrome, an indication for which BPN14770 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This unique mechanism of action has the potential to improve cognitive and memory function in devastating CNS disorders, including FXS, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, learning/developmental disabilities and schizophrenia. BPN14770 currently is approved for investigational use only by the FDA.

 Results demonstrated that CT-P17 has equivalent efficacy to reference adalimumab i.e. ACR20 is 82.7% for both, 2EPs include ACR20/50/70 response rates, mean DAS28, CDAI & SDAI & EULAR (CRP) response, Ctrough of adalimumab is higher for CT-P17 & lower in the ADA positive subgroup than the ADA negative subgroup in both treatment groups, the safety profile is comparable
 Additionally, comparable PK and safety data is presented for CT-P17 in comparison with EU-approved & US-licensed adalimumab in 312 healthy subjects. Celltrion also presented PK and safety data for two delivery methods for CT-P17, the auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS)","INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New data to be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2020 demonstrate that the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and overall safety of CT-P17, a proposed high concentration (100mg/mL) and citrate-free adalimumab biosimilar, is comparable to reference adalimumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

The randomised, double-blind, phase III study investigated the equivalence of CT-P17 to reference adalimumab in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and overall safety over 24 weeks.1 648 patients with active moderate-to-severe RA despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment were randomly assigned to receive 40mg of CT-P17 or reference adalimumab every 2 weeks up to week 24.

Results demonstrated CT-P17 has equivalent efficacy to reference adalimumab – the ACR20 response rate at week 24 was 82.7% (268/324) for both CT-P17 and reference adalimumab. Similar additional secondary efficacy endpoints were seen in terms of ACR20/50/70 response rates, mean DAS28 (CRP), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and EULAR (CRP) response. The PK results in terms of mean Ctrough of adalimumab up to week 24 were slightly higher for CT-P17 and the mean Ctrough was generally lower in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive subgroup than the ADA negative subgroup in both treatment groups. The safety profile of CT-P17 up to week 24 was comparable to that of the reference adalimumab as the majority of events were grade 1 or grade 2 in intensity.1

“These phase III results show a comparable PK, efficacy and safety profile between CT-P17 and the reference adalimumab, building on evidence demonstrating that CT-P17 is equivalent to reference adalimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis”, said Professor Edward Keystone, Senior Consultant Rheumatologist, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. “These promising study results support the use of CT-P17, the first adalimumab biosimilar with high concentration and citrate-free formulation as an alternative option for eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis.”

Further data presented by Celltrion Healthcare at ACR Convergence 2020 investigated the PK and safety of CT-P17 in comparison to EU-approved adalimumab (EU- adalimumab) and US- licensed adalimumab (US- adalimumab) in healthy subjects up to 10 weeks. In this phase I, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 312 healthy subjects aged 19 to 55 years were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either CT-P17, EU- adalimumab or US- adalimumab after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 40mg (100mg/mL). The results showed that the 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the geometric least squares mean ratio of each of the primary PK parameters (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, and Cmax) were within the predefined equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. The overall safety profile was comparable, and the number of subjects who had positive ADA and neutralising ADA (NAb) results were also similar among the three treatment groups.2

Celltrion Healthcare also presented PK and safety data for two delivery methods for CT-P17, the auto-injector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS). As part of the study, 193 healthy subjects were randomly split into two groups to receive 40mg of either CT-P17 AI or CT-P17 PFS. Following a single SC administration of CT-P17 via AI, mean peak and total systemic exposure (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and Cmax) were equivalent with those of CT-P17 PFS, which indicates that CT-P17 AI could be a viable alternative administration option.3

 Result: reduction in the risk of OS (42%); reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death, PFS (41%); showed improvement in both OS and PFS; Grade 3–4 AEs (57% vs 55%), published in the NEJM
 The approval follows an EMA’s CHMP positive opinion received in Sept’2020. The dual regimen also recently included as a class I, A recommendation by the ESMO for unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally","Basel, 2 November 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy.

“Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is the first treatment to be approved in over a decade that has improved overall survival for people with previously untreated advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We’re delighted that people in Europe can now benefit from this combination and we look forward to working with individual countries within the EU to ensure people can access the combination as soon as possible.”

“The results of the IMbrave150 study mark a breakthrough in the treatment of advanced liver cancer, one of the few cancers with a rising death rate and limited options in the first-line setting,” said Dr Arndt Vogel, Professor of Medicine at Hannover Medical School. “After many failures in the last 12 years, the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin shows improvement in overall survival compared to sorafenib and offers patients the opportunity for improved disease control with a high overall response rate.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase III IMbrave150 study, which showed that Tecentriq in combination with Avastin reduced the risk of death (overall survival [OS]) by 42% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47–0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib. IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in both OS and PFS in people with unresectable HCC compared with sorafenib. Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 57% of people receiving Tecentriq and Avastin and 55% of people receiving sorafenib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions for the combination (≥2%) were bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and fever. These results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 14 May 2020.

Today’s approval follows a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in September 2020. In May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, in October 2020 the China National Medical Products Administration approved the combination for the treatment of people with unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. In total, the combination is now approved in 59 countries for people with unresectable HCC. Tecentriq in combination with Avastin was also recently included as a class I, A recommendation by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for the treatment of unresectable HCC, as well as by many clinical practice guidelines globally.

Roche is committed to tackling liver disease right across the disease journey, from the earliest stages through to advanced disease, with the ultimate goal of one day stopping chronic liver disease.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, multicentre, open-label study of 501 people with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy. People were randomised 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq was administered intravenously (IV), 1200mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and Avastin was administered IV, 15mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib was administered by mouth, 400mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. People received the combination or the control arm treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The two primary endpoints were OS and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Additional study endpoints included IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST.

About hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide.1 Every year, more than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC,1,2 with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China.2,3 In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise, accounting for more than 80,000 diagnoses and approximately 77,000 deaths each year.4-7 HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage.1 The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.8

About the Tecentriq and Avastin combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

 Kisqali is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, acts by inhibiting two proteins called CDK4/6","KISQALI® is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to show statistically significant improvement in overall survival (key secondary endpoint) in advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women.1
At the time of the final overall survival analysis, median overall survival was not reached in the KISQALI® arm and was 40.9 months in the placebo arm. The median duration of follow-up was 34.6 months.1
Advanced breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old.2,3
DORVAL, QC, Nov. 2, 2020 /CNW/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis) is pleased to announce that statistically significant overall survival (OS) results for KISQALI® (ribociclib) in combination therapy have now been approved within the KISQALI® Product Monograph. The pivotal Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated KISQALI® with endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to placebo plus endocrine therapy, in pre- and perimenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer.1

At the time of the second (final) prespecified OS analysis, the study met its key secondary endpoint of OS, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS, and was consistent for the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) population and across exploratory subgroups.1

“This data with improved overall survival is very compelling for the medical community when making decisions about the optimal treatment for pre- and perimenopausal patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Dr. Karen Gelmon, Professor of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Medical Oncologist, BC Cancer.

“Overall survival is considered a very important outcome in oncology clinical trials,” said Dr. Nathaniel Bouganim, Medical Oncologist, McGill University Health Centre. “To achieve overall survival benefit in metastatic disease represents a promising advancement for patients, and the medical community looks forward to future data updates on ribociclib.”

For women living with metastatic breast cancer, also known as Stage IV breast cancer, the cancer has spread beyond the breast to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain.4 It may happen before or after treatment, or it may develop from reoccurring breast cancer.5 Although there have been advancements in early detection and treatment, there is still no cure for metastatic breast cancer.6 

“When young women are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, many don’t know what that means and have difficulty processing that the cancer is terminal. Once the news sinks in, they focus on living as well as they can for as long as they can,” said MJ DeCoteau, Founder and Executive Director, Rethink Breast Cancer. “The new ribociclib data showing overall survival benefit in the most common type of breast cancer in young women is an exciting and significant step towards meeting the most urgent unmet need for these women.”

KISQALI® is indicated in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy. In pre/perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. KISQALI® is also indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy.1

“At Novartis, we are at the forefront of driving scientific advancements and are proud of our heritage in breast cancer. Our dedication to breast cancer is reflective of our continued development of multiple compounds within our current pipeline,” said Daniel Hébert, Vice-President, Medical Affairs, Oncology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. Novartis leads the industry in the discovery of new therapies and combinations, especially in HR-positive breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. “We are pleased to make yet another strong medical data announcement around KISQALI® and its potential for overall survival benefit.”

KISQALI® is reimbursed in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan under the respective provincial drug programs. Novartis continues to work towards securing coverage across the country.

About KISQALI® (ribociclib)
KISQALI® is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably. KISQALI® was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

 The trial met its co-1EPs & 2EPs demonstrating deucravacitinib was superior to Otezla (apremilast) in the patients reaching a PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 @16wks. The overall safety profile of deucravacitinib was consistent with previously reported P-II results
 Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165, PO) is the first & only novel selective TYK2 inhibitor, currently being evaluated in psoriasis, PsA, lupus, and IBD","PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced positive results from POETYK PSO-1, the first pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating deucravacitinib (BMS-986165), a novel, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. POETYK PSO-1 evaluated 6 mg of deucravacitinib once daily and met both co-primary endpoints versus placebo, with more patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, defined as at least a 75 percent improvement in PASI, and a static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) after 16 weeks of treatment with deucravacitinib.

The trial also met multiple key secondary endpoints, including showing deucravacitinib was superior to Otezla® (apremilast) in the proportion of patients reaching a PASI 75 response and sPGA 0/1 at Week 16. The overall safety profile of deucravacitinib in the POETYK PSO-1 trial was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 results.

“With limited oral therapeutic options available for psoriasis, there remains a significant need for safe and effective oral therapies. This makes the positive topline results for deucravacitinib in the POETYK PSO-1 trial exciting for the psoriasis community,” said April Armstrong, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Dean and Professor of Dermatology at the University of Southern California. “These findings indicate deucravacitinib has the potential to be a new treatment option for people living with psoriasis and may provide clinically meaningful improvements with the convenience of oral administration.”

The company and principal investigators will complete a full evaluation of the POETYK PSO-1 data and share the detailed results at a future medical meeting. POETYK PSO-1 is the first of two global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of deucravacitinib compared to placebo and Otezla in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Results from the second study, POETYK PSO-2, are expected in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to psoriasis, deucravacitinib is being studied in a wide spectrum of immune-mediated diseases, and the company will present results from its Phase 2 trial in psoriatic arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2020, taking place virtually November 5-9, 2020.

“We are encouraged by the efficacy and safety profile observed in the POETYK PSO-1 study, which supports the strong potential we see for deucravacitinib, our novel, oral, selective TYK2 inhibitor, to be an important new therapy in psoriasis,” said Samit Hirawat, M.D., executive vice president, chief medical officer, global drug development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We recognize there is a significant unmet need for new therapeutic options for people with immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis, and are committed to pursuing potential new medicines that will give physicians additional choices to effectively treat and manage their patients.”

About Deucravacitinib
Deucravacitinib (BMS-986165) is the first and only novel, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor in clinical studies across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Deucravacitinib’s selectivity is driven by a unique mechanism of action that is distinct from other kinase inhibitors. TYK2 is an intracellular signaling kinase that mediates signaling of IL-23, IL-12 and Type I IFN, which are naturally occurring cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses.

Deucravacitinib is being studied in a wide spectrum of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition to POETYK PSO-1, Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating deucravacitinib in four additional Phase 3 studies: POETYK PSO-2 (NCT03611751); POETYK PSO-3 (NCT04167462); POETYK PSO-4 (NCT03924427); POETYK PSO-LTE (NCT04036435). Deucravacitinib is not approved for any use in any country.

About POETYK PSO-1
PrOgram to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of BMS-986165, a selective TYK2 inhibitor PSO-1 (POETYK PSO-1, NCT03624127) is the first of two global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of deucravacitinib compared to placebo and Otezla® (apremilast) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. POETYK PSO-1 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled Phase 3 study. In total, 666 participants diagnosed with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized in the study.

The co-primary outcome measures of the trial were the percentage of participants who achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 and the percentage of participants who achieved static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 to 1 at Week 16 versus placebo. Key secondary outcome measures of the trial include percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 compared to Otezla at Week 16.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a widely prevalent, chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease that substantially impairs patients’ physical health, quality of life and work productivity. Psoriasis is a serious global problem, impacting at least 100 million people worldwide. Up to 90% of patients with psoriasis have psoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by distinct, round or oval plaques typically covered by silvery white scales. People with psoriasis can experience social stigma that can lead to significant psychological distress, while accompanying pain can cause functional disability and reduced quality of life. Psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities that are known to reduce life expectancy, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, depression and malignancies.

 The collaboration will utilize the SomaLogic proteomic technology for the identification of circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers for therapeutic biologics
 SomaLogic’s SomaScan platform makes 5,000 protein measurements simultaneously in small samples of blood, to compare changes in circulating proteins following treatment with FDA-approved biologics and could reduce the need for costly and lengthy comparative clinical studies","BOULDER, Colo., Oct. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SomaLogic, Inc. announced today an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Division of Applied Regulatory Science to evaluate the utility of large-scale analysis of proteins (proteomics) for the identification of biomarkers that may be useful in demonstrating biosimilarity of a proposed biosimilar to a reference biologic.

The collaborative project will use data generated on the SomaLogic SomaScan® Platform, which makes 5,000 protein measurements simultaneously in small samples of blood, to compare changes in circulating proteins following treatment with FDA-approved biologics. The protein measurements from an FDA-approved reference biologic could then be compared to those generated by a candidate biosimilar drug.

“Circulating proteins, when measured at the broadest scale, provide system-wide information on the dynamic effects of drug exposure-response,” said Stephen Williams, M.D., chief medical officer at SomaLogic. “Comparing the “blood protein fingerprint” of a biosimilar to a reference biologic has the potential to be more efficient and precise than clinical observations for establishing biosimilarity.”

Despite potential cost savings in the billions, the use of biosimilars in the US has been less widespread than originally hoped. At present, there are only 28 biosimilars approved by the FDA for only a small number of biologic drugs. Regulatory approval of a proposed biosimilar requires demonstration that it is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-approved reference product, a process that can take several years. The research at the center of this agreement aims to advance the use of novel tools and approaches that could streamline biosmiliar development.

Under the terms of the new five-year agreement, SomaLogic will collaborate with the FDA to identify circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers and analytical approaches that could be used to demonstrate biosimilarity of a candidate biosimilar drug to a reference FDA-approved biologic drug. If successful, this proteomic strategy could reduce the need for costly and lengthy comparative clinical studies. This, in turn, should streamline the development of biosimilars and thus accelerate delivery of safe, effective, and affordable biosimilar treatments to patients.

Specific details of the agreement were not disclosed.

51597,CEPI to Invest ~$328M in Clover's COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate,CEPI Extends Partnership With Clover Biopharmaceuticals to Fund COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Through Global Phase 2/3 Study to Licensure,"CEPI’s total investment in Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate will be up to $328 M, including $69.5M previously announced have funded preclinical studies and P-l study, preparations for the global pivotal P-ll/lll efficacy study, and initial manufacturing scale-up activities
 The expanded collaboration will provide $258.5M for a global pivotal P-ll/lll efficacy clinical trial which is expected to begin before the end of 2020 and generates the safety and efficacy data to support licensure of the vaccine candidate in China and across the globe
 The collaboration anticipates that the vaccine will be made available for procurement and allocation through the COVAX Facility, which aims to fairly distribute 2B doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021","OSLO, Norway & CHENGDU, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced that it will fund the development of the protein-based S-Trimer COVID-19 vaccine candidate by Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc (China) (“Clover”) through a global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy clinical trial and to licensure in China and globally, if the vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.

CEPI’s total investment in Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate will be up to $328 million, including previously announced commitments of $69.5 million which have funded preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials, preparations for the global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy study, and initial manufacturing scale-up activities. Promising preclinical and preliminary Phase 1 data – which will be published in a peer-reviewed publication in the near future – indicate that S-Trimer is well-tolerated and produces strong neutralizing antibody and Th1-biased cell-mediated immune responses, which merit ongoing evaluation of the vaccine candidate.

The expanded partnership is a result of Clover’s successful early stage clinical development of the S-Trimer vaccine candidate. It will provide full funding for a global pivotal Phase 2/3 efficacy clinical trial of S-Trimer which is expected to begin before the end of 2020 and aims to generate the necessary safety and efficacy data to support licensure of the vaccine candidate. It will also fund additional clinical studies in special populations, such as people with autoimmune conditions, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women and children. In parallel to the clinical development process, the programme will continue scaling up the manufacturing process to potentially allow the production of more than one billion doses annually, and build up vaccine inventory which – if the vaccine is proven to be safe and effective – could be deployed rapidly upon licensure.

Clover is exploring development pathways for the S-Trimer vaccine to be made accessible to populations in China and globally, if it is proven to be safe and effective. CEPI and Clover are committed to ensuring equitable global access to the S-Trimer vaccine, and the agreement therefore anticipates that vaccine output funded by CEPI’s investment – potentially hundreds of millions of doses per year – will be made available for procurement and allocation through the COVAX Facility. The COVAX Facility is a global initiative which aims to procure and fairly distribute two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021, to help protect the most at-risk groups in all participating countries.

Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI said:

“The clinical development and manufacturing progress of Clover’s S-Trimer vaccine candidate are very promising so far, so I am pleased to extend our partnership with Clover through to potential licensure of the vaccine.”

“CEPI’s expanded investment will fund critical late-stage clinical trials to establish the efficacy of the vaccine, in parallel to scaling up the manufacturing process with the goal of making potentially hundreds of millions of doses of this vaccine available to those who need it through COVAX, if it is proven to be safe and effective.”

Joshua Liang, CEO of Clover said:“We are honoured to receive CEPI’s continued investment which is based on months of close collaboration and early preclinical, manufacturing scale-up, and clinical success in the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine for COVID-19. This expanded partnership enables Clover to advance our S-Trimer vaccine candidate into a global Phase 2/3 efficacy study by the end of this year and subsequently to Chinese and global licensure in 2021. We look forward to continuing our partnership with CEPI as we stay committed to developing a safe and efficacious vaccine for communities in need around the globe.”

COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine

Utilizing Clover’s proprietary Trimer-Tag© technology, S-Trimer is a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein subunit vaccine candidate. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry, making it the primary target antigen for vaccine development. S-Trimer resembles the native trimeric viral spike protein and is produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

CEPI’s COVID-19 vaccine programme

Built on the principles of speed, scale and equitable access, CEPI is supporting the research and development of a diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates based on a range of vaccine approaches. Of the nine vaccine candidates currently in the CEPI portfolio – the world’s largest – eight have entered clinical trials out of 44 globally.

CEPI has raised US$1.3bn in support of COVID-19 vaccine research and development, but urgently needs $800m in additional funds to achieve its aim of developing three safe and effective vaccines which will be made globally available through COVAX. These funds are vital for CEPI to progress the most promising vaccine candidates in the portfolio through crucial late-stage clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy, and ultimately to licensure.

CEPI, alongside Gavi and the World Health Organisation, co-leads the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator – known as COVAX – which is working to accelerate research and development for promising vaccine candidates, manufacture doses at scale, and ensure rapid global access.

CEPI opened a Representative Office in Shanghai in April 2020. Through its Shanghai Representative Office, CEPI is seeking to cooperate broadly in China on COVID-19 vaccine development and build robust collaborations to prevent and control other potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future.

51607,Boston Scientific's Ranger DCB Receives the US FDA's Approval for Peripheral Artery Disease in the SFA and PPA,Boston Scientific Receives FDA Approval for the Ranger™ Drug-Coated Balloon,"The approval is based on the RANGER II SFA pivotal study assessing the Ranger DCB vs standard PTA for the treatment in patients with PAD in the SFA & PPA
 The study met its both 1EPs @12mos. i.e. MAE (94.1% vs 83.5%); lesion revascularization rate (5.5% vs 16.5%); Binary primary patency (82.9% vs 66.3%); primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate (89.8% vs 74.0%). The DCB has demonstrated 90% primary patency in COMPARE trial
 The company expects to initiate a registry of the Ranger DCB and the Eluvia stent in the coming months to gather additional RWE and plans to launch the device in the US","MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Ranger™ Drug-Coated Balloon, developed for the treatment of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery (PPA).

Approximately 200 million people around the world are affected by PAD1, a common circulatory problem in which plaque builds up and narrows arteries, consequently reducing blood flow to limbs. The Ranger DCB was designed with a low therapeutic drug dose and proprietary coating which efficiently transfers the drug into the tissue, resulting in high primary patency rates and low systemic drug exposure for patients. The low-profile platform of the balloon also assists clinicians in performing streamlined procedures and navigating through challenging anatomy in order to deliver consistent therapy.

“This approval allows us to bring more treatment options with exceptional outcomes and proven safety to U.S. physicians and their patients who are facing this challenging disease,” said Jeff Mirviss, president, Peripheral Interventions, Boston Scientific. “Adding the Ranger DCB to our drug-eluting portfolio, which also includes our Eluvia™ Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System, reinforces our commitment to providing differentiated technology with strong clinical evidence that supports data-driven treatment decisions for millions of patients suffering from PAD worldwide.”

The FDA approval is based on results from the RANGER II SFA pivotal trial, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Ranger DCB versus standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of patients with PAD in the SFA and PPA. In the randomized controlled trial, both primary endpoints were met:

The primary safety endpoint of 12-month freedom from major adverse events (MAE) was 94.1% for those treated with the Ranger DCB versus 83.5% for standard PTA (Pnon-inferiority <0.0001).2
Additionally, patients who received therapy with the Ranger DCB had a significantly lower target lesion revascularization rate – a component of MAE – of 5.5% in contrast to 16.5% observed with standard PTA (p=0.0011), substantially reducing a patient’s need for repeat procedures.2
The primary efficacy endpoint of 12-month binary primary patency – a measure of the target vessel remaining unobstructed – was 82.9% for the Ranger DCB and 66.3% for standard PTA (p=0.0017). Primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate was 89.8% for the Ranger DCB and 74.0% for PTA at 12 months (p=0.0005).2
“The Ranger DCB eases deliverability for a wide range of lesion complexities via a low profile platform that is compatible with smaller diameter guidewires and has shown consistent results in multiple randomized controlled trials,” said Ravish Sachar, M.D., UNC Rex Hospital Physician-in-Chief for Heart and Vascular services and principal investigator of the RANGER II SFA trial. “For physicians seeking to limit systemic drug loss without compromising outcomes, data demonstrate the Ranger DCB is a safe and effective treatment option.”

The Ranger DCB also demonstrated nearly 90% primary patency in the investigator-sponsored COMPARE trial3 – the first head-to-head prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare two different DCBs. In the trial, the Ranger DCB demonstrated a similar primary patency rate of 88.4% to that of the 89.4% observed with IN.PACT™ Admiral™ Drug-Coated Balloon (Medtronic) by Kaplan-Meier estimate (p=0.81), with a significantly lower drug dose density (2 µg/mm2 paclitaxel versus 3.5 µg/mm2 paclitaxel, respectively).3,4

Boston Scientific expects to initiate a registry of the Ranger DCB and the Eluvia stent in the coming months to gather additional real-world evidence, which will add to the breadth of clinical data collected on these devices to date. The registry is expected to include five years of patient follow-up with an emphasis on enrolling patient populations who have been historically underrepresented in clinical trials studying treatments for PAD.

The company announced CE Mark for the Ranger DCB in 2014 and plans to immediately launch the device in the U.S.

The US FDA is not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application
 Additionally, the company is expecting to complete enrollment in a P-II study assessing vosoritide in ~70 infants and young children with achondroplasia, aged 0-<60mos., for 52wks.
 Vosoritide (qd) is an investigational injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia and has received the US FDA’s & EMA’s ODD for the same","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Nov. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for vosoritide, an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. This acceptance by the FDA marks the first marketing application accepted for a treatment for achondroplasia in the United States

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is Aug. 20, 2021. The FDA has informed the company that they are not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.

Although the FDA did not identify any filing issues with the NDA, the Agency reiterated a position raised during the Pediatric Advisory Committee (PAC) and Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) held on May 11, 2018 recommending two-year  controlled trials in different age groups.  BioMarin believes the highly persuasive outcomes from the one-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, coupled with data from the Phase 2 program with up to 5 years of long-term follow-up that has been compared to robust natural history data on growth, offers a rigorous and reliable method to assess whether vosoritide has a durable impact on the rate of endochondral bone growth that ultimately increases final adult height.  This information was included in the marketing application.

While not part of the vosoritide marketing application, in Q4, the Company is also expecting to complete enrollment in a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 70 infants and young children with achondroplasia, aged zero to less than 60 months, for a period of 52 weeks.  The study will be followed by a subsequent open-label extension trial when all subjects receive active treatment. Children in this study will complete a minimum three-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth prior to dosing in the Phase 2 study. Children in this study will have completed a minimum three-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth prior to entering the Phase 2 study. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety, tolerability, and the effect of vosoritide on height Z-scores, which is the number of standard deviations in relation to the mean height of age-matched, average stature children.  The company also plans to augment the height Z-score data with assessments including proportionality, functionality, quality of life, sleep apnea, and foramen magnum dimension, as well as the advent of major illnesses and surgeries.

“We are looking forward to working with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the potentially first pharmacological treatment for children with achondroplasia.  In addition to the completed clinical studies included in the application, we have included a natural history study to understand the progression of achondroplasia and medical implications,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin.  “Our extensive development program has been focused on addressing the underlying cause of achondroplasia.  We continue to respect the community’s range of views around treatment options.  We are grateful to the families who have participated in the clinical trials, the advocacy groups from around the world, and the study investigators, all who have been on this journey with us to deliver a treatment choice and contribute to further understanding achondroplasia medically and scientifically.”

“This is important progress that could lead to the first pharmacological treatment of the underlying cause of achondroplasia.  As a treating physician, I feel that it is very important that such treatment options become available to families who may want to consider them for their child,”  said John A. Phillips III, M.D., Vanderbilt University Medical Center (David T Karzon Professor of Pediatrics) and investigator for the vosoritide clinical program.  “The comprehensive clinical program for vosoritide provides scientific and clinical knowledge that focuses on the safety and efficacy of vosoritide and better understanding of the basic cause of achondroplasia, its natural history and treatment.”

“We are hopeful that our community is one step closer to having access to the first therapeutic choice for children and families affected by achondroplasia,” said Munira Haider, co-founder of Growing Stronger.  “We advocate for rigorous scientific and medical research to improve the quality of medical care for little people.”

Growing Stronger’s mission is to improve the quality of medical care for people through supporting research. The organization raises nonprofit donations that are granted to researchers focused on dwarfism.

Regulatory Status in the U.S. and Europe

BioMarin previously announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Company’s Marketing Authorization Application. Vosoritide has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The Orphan Drug Designation program is intended to advance the evaluation and development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.

About Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans, is characterized by slowing of endochondral ossification, which results in disproportionate short stature and disordered architecture in the long bones, spine, face and base of the skull. This condition is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of bone growth. Beyond disproportionate short stature, people with achondroplasia can experience serious health complications, including foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, bowed legs, mid-face hypoplasia, permanent sway of the lower back, spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. Some of these complications can result in the need for invasive surgeries such as spinal cord decompression and straightening of bowed legs. In addition, studies show increased mortality at every age.

More than 80% of children with achondroplasia have parents of average stature and have the condition as the result of a spontaneous gene mutation.  The worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births.  Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open”, typically those under 18 years of age. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia.  In the U.S., Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and most of Asia Pacific, there are currently no licensed medicines for achondroplasia.

51628,Jounce Stops Enrollment in P-II EMERGE Study Evaluating Vopratelimab for Lung Cancer,Jounce Therapeutics Announces Update on Vopratelimab Program,"The company will not expand the P-II EMERGE study that assesses Vopratelimab + ipilimumab in PD-(L)1 inhibitor experienced NSCLC patient. Early evaluation of the study showed that the trial will not meet pre-specified interim criteria for continuation of enrollment
 The company also reported the first patient dosing in P-II SELECT study assessing Vopratelimab + JTX-4014 vs JTX-4014 alone in 75 immunotherapy naïve NSCLC patients who have been pre-selected with the TISvopra predictive biomarker with its expected preliminary efficacy data in 2021
 Vopratelimab is a mAb that binds to and activates ICOS which is a protein on the surface of certain T cells found in many solid tumors","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JNCE), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers, today provided an update on its vopratelimab (vopra) program. The intent of the EMERGE Phase 2 trial was to induce ICOS hi CD4 T cells with ipilimumab, and then administer vopra with the goal of increasing proliferation and expansion of these ICOS hi CD4 T cells, which were associated with durable clinical benefit in the ICONIC trial of vopra alone and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Early evaluation of the data from the EMERGE trial of vopra in combination with ipilimumab in PD-(L)1 inhibitor experienced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients indicates the trial will not meet pre-specified interim criteria for continuation of enrollment. Therefore, the EMERGE trial will not be expanded. The company also announced the first patient dosed in the SELECT Phase 2 trial, supporting vopra’s potential in combination with JTX-4014 in immunotherapy naïve biomarker-selected NSCLC patients.

“We are disappointed that an early look at the EMERGE data indicates that we will not meet our pre-specified interim criteria for continued enrollment,” said Beth Trehu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Jounce Therapeutics. “Less than 50% of the EMERGE patients had emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells after ipilimumab treatment, indicating that CD4 T cell activation by CTLA-4 inhibitors may be impaired in PD-(L)1 inhibitor resistant patients. Patients who have progressed on or after PD-1 inhibitor therapies represent a large and growing unmet need and new therapeutic mechanisms may be needed to more effectively treat these patients. We would like to thank the patients, investigators and study teams for their participation in the EMERGE trial.”

“The PD-(L)1 experienced or resistant population continues to prove difficult to treat. To bring necessary benefit to these patients it is becoming clearer that novel approaches beyond T cells may be needed as part of the solution,” said Richard Murray, Ph.D., chief executive officer and president of Jounce Therapeutics. “Our pipeline beyond vopra is focused on these novel approaches and we believe our existing programs, particularly, JTX-8064, our lead macrophage program targeting LILRB2 (ILT4), and other programs from our discovery platform, are poised to make meaningful contributions to both the PD-(L)1 naïve and resistant populations.”

EMERGE Enrollment, Dosing and Safety
Fifty-nine patients were enrolled, 50 of whom are evaluable based on pre-specified criteria which required at least one dose of each drug and at least one CT scan for response assessment or clinical progression without a CT. Vopra continued to be safe and the combination with ipilimumab was well tolerated. The type and frequency of adverse events were similar to those seen with ipilimumab.

Summary of EMERGE Preliminary Efficacy Data

* Dose not protocol-specified, due to dosing error at a single study site; ** Confidence interval; *** Not estimable; Ipilimumab was dosed for a maximum of 4 doses. Data as of October 26, 2020

The data for all doses combined, with or without including the 10 subjects dosed at .01 mg/kg, did not meet the pre-specified criteria for continuation of enrollment in the trial, with tumor reduction in 38% of patients and one confirmed RECIST 1.1 response. In the .10 mg/kg cohort, 55% of patients had tumor reduction and confirmed overall response rate (ORR) is 4.5%. Median overall survival (OS) for all dose groups combined was 11.6 months and has not been reached in the .10 and .03 mg/kg cohorts. Nine patients remain on study, including four patients continuing to benefit on vopra alone after completion of up to four ipilimumab doses. The biomarker analysis is not yet complete.

EMERGE Interim Analysis Clinical Criteria to Expand Trial

Tumor reduction in ≥ 50% of patients,
Median overall survival tracking to ≥ 13 months, and
Overall response rate ≥ 10%
Interim analysis criteria were selected to provide preliminary evidence that a combination of vopra and ipilimumab could potentially be superior to docetaxel in a randomized Phase 3 trial with an overall survival endpoint. Early data evaluation indicates, across all EMERGE doses, these interim criteria cannot be met and EMERGE will not be expanded beyond current enrollment.

SELECT
SELECT and EMERGE were developed to address distinct hypotheses for the potential of vopra and ICOS hi CD4 cells to improve patient outcomes. These trials are also addressing different patient populations, PD-(L)1 inhibitor resistant versus PD-(L)1 inhibitor naïve and biomarker selected.

The randomized Phase 2 SELECT trial of vopra in combination with Jounce’s PD-1 inhibitor, JTX-4014 began enrollment in October 2020. The trial compares vopra plus JTX-4014 to JTX-4014 alone in immunotherapy naïve NSCLC patients who have been pre-selected with the TISvopra predictive biomarker. SELECT will enroll approximately 75 patients. TISvopra is an 18 gene RNA tumor inflammation signature which was optimized to predict the emergence of ICOS hi CD4 T cells and associated clinical benefit. SELECT is powered to demonstrate the statistical superiority of the combination of vopratelimab plus JTX-4014 compared to JTX-4014 alone. Preliminary efficacy data from the SELECT trial is expected in 2021.

51638,Abbott to Launch its Cardiac Mapping Platform in Europe and Australia,ABBOTT INTRODUCES NEXT-GENERATION 3D CARDIAC MAPPING PLATFORM IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA,"The company has received CE mark in EU and approval in Australia for its new EnSite X EP system which offers the option to navigate the cardiac anatomy in two different ways on one platform.
 The system can create a 3D model of the patient’s cardiac anatomy in real time and will enable physicians to spot areas of the heart that need ablation treatment. The system is currently pending 510(k) clearance from the US FDA
 Additionally, the company has received the US FDA & CE mark approval for the EnSite LiveView Dynamic Display, which allows data from the Advisor HD Grid mapping catheter, Sensor Enabled to be visualized in real-time during cardiac ablation procedures","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Nov. 2, 2020 — Abbott today announced it has received CE Mark and approval in Australia for its new EnSite™ X EP System, and is launching the system throughout Europe and Australia. The EnSite X System is the only system that offers the option to navigate the cardiac anatomy two different ways on one platform. Abbott sought physician feedback to develop the EnSite X System to meet current needs as well as address emerging opportunities during cardiac ablation procedures. The new cardiac mapping platform builds upon the company’s electrophysiology portfolio and is designed to improve how physicians deliver ablation therapy to treat abnormal heart rhythms.

Cardiac mapping systems allow electrophysiologists to create a map of the heart, helping them get a clear picture of the electrical signals that control cardiac rhythms. Once a map is created, physicians can identify electrical disruptions—or areas of the heart causing heart rhythm problems—and use ablation therapy to treat the issue. Cardiac ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that can treat abnormally fast heartbeats by creating lesions (ablations) in small areas of heart tissue that a physician has identified as causing the arrhythmia.

The EnSite X System has advanced imaging capabilities that allow for the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient’s cardiac anatomy in real-time, allowing physicians to clearly see areas of the heart that need ablation treatment. Physicians can choose traditional impedance monitoring (using mechanical activity of the heart) or electromagnetic technology, which allows precise location of Abbott’s sensor-enabled catheters during treatment.

“The new EnSite X System will fundamentally change how physicians approach longer, more complex ablation procedures as a result of its improved stability, faster mapping and better model visualization,” said Prof. Paolo Della Bella, Head of the Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmology at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. “In my first cases with the system it’s been apparent that the system is an important step forward in terms of technological capabilities and also truly helps improve my clinical analysis by protecting for patient movements.”

The various aspects of the EnSite X System are designed to work in harmony and allow ongoing updates as technology advances. The new mapping system is among a series of product-focused activities from Abbott designed to improve patient care and meet the needs of electrophysiologists around the world.

The company also recently secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CE Mark approval for the EnSite™ LiveView Dynamic Display, which allows data from the Advisor™ HD Grid mapping catheter, Sensor Enabled™ to be visualized in real-time during cardiac ablation procedures. The Advisor HD Grid catheter, SE is designed to capture information often missed with traditional mapping catheters. Additionally, physicians use magnetically sensor enabled technology, such as the TactiCath™ Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™, for precise location and navigation within the heart.

“The high-density cardiac mapping capability this new system offers helps me to more quickly and accurately collect data and diagnose arrhythmias,” said Prof. Isabel Deisenhofer, Head of Electrophysiology at the German Heart Center, Munich Germany. “The combination of the EnSite X System with the Advisor HD Grid mapping catheter, SE allows me to most effectively treat each patient’s unique needs without having to compromise our workflow in the EP lab.”

The EnSite X EP System is currently pending 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

About Cardiac Ablation:

When physicians use catheter ablation to treat cardiac arrhythmias, long flexible tubes — called catheters — are inserted into the heart to study the arrhythmia and to deliver radio frequency energy. Heat generated from the radio frequency energy creates a scar on the tissue where the abnormal heartbeats originate. As a result, this tissue is no longer capable of conducting or sustaining the arrhythmia.

About Abbott’s Electrophysiology Business

The Abbott electrophysiology (EP) business is one of the fastest growing segments within the company’s broader device portfolio. The Abbott EP product portfolio gives physicians the diagnostic, access, mapping and therapy solutions they need with designed integration for enhanced diagnosis and treatment of heart arrhythmias. A leader in collaborating with world-renowned electrophysiologists, clinicians and hospital administrators, Abbott develops safe and cost-effective treatment solutions for patients in need of advanced ablation therapies.

51650,"Henlius Present Results of HLX03 (biosimilar, adalimumab) in P-lll Study for Plaque Psoriasis at EADV 2020",The Results of the Phase 3 Study of Henlius’ Adalimumab Biosimilar HLX03 Presented on EADV 2020,"The P-III HLX03-Ps03 study involves comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity assessing of HLX03 (80mg, qd) with reference adalimumab in 262 Chinese patients in the ratio of (1:1) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
 Result: On 1EPs % improvement of PASIwk16 (83.48% vs 82.02%), least square mean difference (1.46%), no significant differences between the treatment groups in 2EPs that include PASI 75, PGA reaching clearance and change in DLQI
 HLX03 is an adalimumab biosimilar to be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, RA & AS","The 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) virtual conference is held from 29th to 31st October 2020. At this meeting, Henlius released the results of HLX03-Ps03, the Phase 3 study of its independently developed adalimumab biosimilar HLX03 in Chinese patients with psoriasis. The data was presented in an E-poster. The title of this study is “Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of the Biosimilar HLX03 Compared with Adalimumab in Chinese Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis: A Randomised, Double-blind, Phase 3 Equivalence Study”. Professor Jianzhong Zhang from Peking University People’s Hospital, is the leading principle investigator of this study. It’s the first time that Henlius has released this Phase 3 study results. This study will help to accumulate more clinical evidence and experience of adalimumab biosimilar in this patient population.
HLX03 is an adalimumab biosimilar independently developed by Henlius in accordance with the “Technical Guidelines of Development and Evaluation of Biosimilar Drugs” to be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis etc. Different from currently approved adalimumab biosimilars in China, the Phase 3 clinical trial of HLX03 was conducted among Chinese patients with psoriasis and provided valuable data for this population. The results show that the efficacy of HLX03 for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is equivalent to that of the reference adalimumab injection, and it is also similar to the reference drug in terms of safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics. As of now, the new drug application (NDA) for HLX03 was accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), and was assigned to the priority review list by the NMPA. Recently, Henlius drug substance (DS) line and drug product (DP) line for the production of HLX03 has successfully passed the on-site inspection conducted by Shanghai Medical Products Administration. HLX03 is expected to be approved for launch by the end of 2020, which hopefully will benefit more patients with autoimmune diseases in China.
Study Design

HLX03-Ps03 is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled, phase 3 study (NCT03316781) comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX03 with reference adalimumab in Chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Enrolled patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either HLX03 or reference adalimumab by subcutaneous injection with an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 1 Day 1, followed by a dose of 40 mg at Week 2 Day 1, and then 40 mg every two weeks for up to Week 48. The primary endpoint was the percentage of improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at Week 16 (PASIwk16) relative to baseline.
Results

Efficacy
1）Primary Endpoint
262 patients were enrolled (HLX03, n = 132; Reference adalimumab, n = 130) in this study. Per FAS, the percentage improvement of PASIwk16 was 83.48% in HLX03 group and 82.02% in reference adalimumab group. The least square mean difference was 1.46% (95% CI: −3.86%, 6.79%), which fell entirely in the pre-defined equivalence margins (±15%), demonstrating equivalent efficacy between HLX03 and reference adalimumab.
2）Secondary Endpoints
There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in secondary endpoints (including the percentage of subjects reaching an improvement of PASI by at least 75% relative to baseline, the percentage of improvement of PASI relative to baseline, the percentage of subjects with Physician’s Global Assessment [PGA] reaching clearance or close to clearance, and the change in Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] relative to baseline) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 32, 50.
Safety and Immunogenicity
The safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between HLX03 and reference adalimumab.
Conclusion

The results of the phase 3 study demonstrated the equivalence in efficacy between HLX03 and reference adalimumab with similar safety and immunogenicity profiles. HLX03 is expected to provide an alternative treatment option for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as an adalimumab biosimilar candidate.

51669,BioInvent Presents New Clinical and Preclinical Data of BI-1206 at ASH Annual Meeting,"BioInvent presents promising new clinical and preclinical data on anti-FcγRllB antibody, BI-1206, at the ASH Annual Meeting","The data includes P-l/lla study involves assessing BI-1206 + rituximab in patients with FL, MZL and MCL who have r/r to rituximab. The study demonstrated at BI-1206 is generating the first signs of clinical response in patients
 The company also presents results from two preclinical studies. The preclinical data further reinforce the efficacy and tolerability profile of BI-1206
 BI-1206 has a novel mode-of-action, acts by blocking the single inhibitory Ab checkpoint receptor FcγRIIB to unlock anti-cancer immunity in both liquid and solid tumors. The therapy is currently being evaluated in P-I/II study in combination with Keytruda & in P-I/IIa study in combination with MabThera (rituximab) for NHL","LUND, Sweden, Nov. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent” or the “Company”) (OMXS: BINV), a biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel and first-in-class immune-modulatory antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, today announces it will present new clinical and preclinical data on its novel anti-FcγRIIB antibody, BI-1206, at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place virtually on December 5-8, 2020.

This includes preliminary data from a Phase I/IIa trial of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have relapsed or are refractory to rituximab.

The data demonstrate that increasing doses of BI-1206 from 30 mg to 70 or 100 mg gave rise to a supra-proportional increase in the maximum concentration recorded, as well as an increase in the half-life of BI-1206. In addition, the higher dose levels (70 or 100 mg) showed close to full receptor saturation up to 72 hours. Increasing the dose further will likely give rise to sustained receptor saturation over an extended period. Furthermore, complete (CR) and partial (PR) clinical responses, as assessed by reduction of tumor size, were observed, in particular in the 70 mg cohort, where 3 of 5 patients have shown clinical responses.

“These data are very encouraging and indicate the strong potential of BI-1206 to make a significant difference to patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL. In particular, these preliminary data suggest that BI-1206 is generating the first signs of clinical responses in patients who have relapsed after treatment with rituximab. Importantly, overcoming target-mediated drug disposition will allow weekly or even less frequent dosing,” said Martin Welschof, CEO of BioInvent.

“Our recent China licensing agreement for BI-1206 with CASI Pharmaceuticals is an important validation of BioInvent’s technology, expertise and business model. It provides further impetus to our lead drug candidate, and we look forward to continuing development of this novel treatment option in hematological cancers and solid tumors, and bringing it closer to the market.”

BioInvent will also present results from two preclinical studies with BI-1206. Results from the first study show that BI-1206 had single agent activity in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model comprising ibrutinib-venetoclax resistant MCL cells in vivo. BI-1206 enhanced the in vivo efficacy of ibrutinib plus rituximab and venetoclax plus rituximab and overcame resistance to these treatments, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects.

In the second preclinical study in mice, pre-medication with two doses of corticosteroids (16-24h and 1h prior to infusion) prevented infusion-related reactions associated with intravenous anti-FcyRIIB administration. This pre-medication regimen has been implemented in the clinical trials of BI-1206 and shown to greatly improve the tolerability profile.

BI-1206 has a novel mode-of-action, blocking the single inhibitory antibody checkpoint receptor FcγRIIB to unlock anti-cancer immunity in both liquid and solid tumors. BI-1206 is BioInvent’s lead drug candidate and is being investigated in a Phase I/II trial, in combination with anti-PD1 therapy Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), in solid tumors, and in a Phase I/IIa trial in combination with MabThera® (rituximab) for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

51684,Novartis Reports Results of Cosentyx (secukinumab) in P-IIIb ULTIMATE Study for Psoriatic Arthritis,Novartis Cosentyx shows early synovitis reduction in patients with psoriatic arthritis in first-of-its-kind study,"The P-IIIb ULTIMATE study involves assessing Cosentyx (300/150mg) vs PBO weekly for a mos. with treatment starting @4wks., followed by a once-a-month dose for the next 11mos. in 166 biologic-naïve patients in a ratio (1:1) with active PsA
 The study reduction of synovitis @12wks. with an early improvement observed as 1wk., ACR20 (68% vs 34%); ACR50 (46% vs 9%,) & enthesitis (change in SPARCC, -2.4 vs -1.7); safety profile was consistent with previous studies @12wks.
 Cosentyx is the first & only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits IL-17A. Novartis anticipates disclosing full 24-week data from the ongoing ULTIMATE trial at the EULAR in 2021 and final analysis at ACR 2021","Basel, November 5, 2020 — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced 12-week results from the first-of-its-kind Phase IIIb ULTIMATE randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated the significant treatment response of Cosentyx® (secukinumab) on synovitis (joint lining inflammation) in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) versus placebo. Synovitis was assessed using an advanced and sensitive imaging technique called Power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS). These data are being presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) All-Virtual Annual Meeting, November 5-9, 2020.

“Psoriatic arthritis can have a significant impact on a patient’s joints. Joint lining inflammation, also known as synovitis, if left untreated, can cause pain to worsen, joint damage and may decrease physical function,” said Dr. Maria A. D’Agostino, Professor of Rheumatology at the Catholic University of Rome. “These data are highly encouraging, showing Cosentyx can significantly reduce synovitis at Week 12 versus placebo with results seen as early as Week 1, and that ultrasound is a sensitive and objective tool to monitor joint inflammation in PsA patients.”

The use of a standardized ultrasound synovitis score (GLOESS) as the primary endpoint showed objectively the significant benefit of Cosentyx versus placebo on synovitis at Week 12 with an early improvement observed from Week one. Treatment with Cosentyx also significantly improved key secondary endpoints versus placebo, including ACR20 (68% vs 34%, respectively), ACR50 (46% vs 9%, respectively) and enthesitis (mean change from baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada enthesitis index score [SPARCC] of -2.4 vs -1.7 respectively)1. The safety profile of Cosentyx through 12 weeks was consistent with previous studies1.

Novartis anticipates disclosing full 24-week data from the ongoing ULTIMATE trial at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual meeting in 2021 and final analysis at ACR 2021.

“As a strong believer in the diagnostic and treatment monitoring benefits of ultrasound, this first large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in PsA with an ultrasonographic primary endpoint is incredibly exciting. The ability to use a sensitive imaging technique to assess synovitis and enthesitis in PsA represents a breakthrough in how we conceptualize treatment goals,” said Dr. Catherine Bakewell of Intermountain Medical Group in Salt Lake City, UT and an investigator in the ULTIMATE study. “In addition to other measures, PDUS helps to provide earlier insight into treatment response, and that patients are more effectively treated across multiple domains of this heterogeneous psoriatic disease spectrum.”

PsA is a complex disease with multiple manifestations driving patient symptoms3,4. In PsA, synovitis may lead to joint damage and if left untreated, the joint damage can be irreversible5,6. In addition to reducing synovitis, Cosentyx has been proven to provide long-lasting inhibition of radiographic progression in PsA, limiting joint damage and helping to improve outcomes for patients with this debilitating condition7,8.

Plain Language Media Summaries for ULTIMATE and other key abstracts presented at ACR 2020 are available from the Novartis website: https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/immunology-dermatology/abstract-summaries-acr

About Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
PsA is estimated to affect up to 50 million people worldwide9,10. It is part of a family of life-long inflammatory diseases (spondyloarthritis) that target the joints and is closely associated with psoriasis10. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis may develop PsA10. Symptoms of PsA include joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful swelling of the tendons and irreversible joint damage10.

About ULTIMATE
ULTIMATE is the first ongoing 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIIb study using ultrasound to assess time-course of response of Cosentyx on synovitis in psoriatic arthritis. The study enrolled 166 adult biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either secukinumab (300-mg or 150-mg according to severity of skin disease) or placebo weekly for a month with treatment starting at Week 4, followed by a once-a-month dose for the next 11 months.

The primary endpoint is the difference in mean change from baseline to Week 12 between secukinumab and placebo in Global Omeract-European League Against Rheumatism Ultrasound Synovitis Score (GLOESS). GLOESS is a standardized composite score that has shown to be sensitive to change and is able to detect and score synovitis11. Secondary endpoints include ACR20, ACR50 and change in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index from baseline to Week 12 compared with placebo.

ACR20 and ACR50 are composite measures defined as both improvement of 20% or 50% in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% or 50% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual analog pain scale and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein12. The SPARCC enthesitis index is a validated clinical tool for evaluation of enthesitis13,14.

About Cosentyx® (secukinumab)
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)15-17. Cosentyx is the only biologic with proven efficacy in all key manifestations of PsA18.

Cosentyx is backed by more than 12 years of clinical experience and long-term five-year data across three indications of psoriasis, PsA and AS, as well as data from real-world evidence19-24. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 400,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch2 and plans to expand to 10 indications over the next 10 years.

Additionally, Novavax has multiple agreements for the supply of NVX-CoV2373 directly to the US, UK, Canada, and through partnerships, supply to Japan, South Korea, and India","GAITHERSBURG, Md., Nov. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced the signing of a non-binding Heads of Terms document with the Australian Government to supply 40 million doses of the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, for the Australian community.

“This arrangement with the Australian Government reflects the importance of the ongoing clinical development of NVX-CoV2373, and will ensure that the citizens of Australia will have access to its supply,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “We are pleased with the progress of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and are pressing forward to deliver efficacy data for NVX-CoV2373, with interim data in this event-driven trial expected as soon as early first quarter 2021.”

The Heads of Terms provides for the delivery of NVX-CoV2373 to Australia starting as early as the first half of 2021, subject to the successful completion of Phase 3 clinical development and approval of the vaccine by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The vaccine regimen is expected to require two doses per individual, administered 21 days apart.

To date, Novavax has established various agreements for the supply of NVX-CoV2373 directly to the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada and now Australia, and through partnerships, supply to Japan, South Korea and India.

Australia’s clinical trial contribution

Australia has played a pivotal role in the clinical development program for NVX-CoV2373. Australian clinical researchers led the global Phase 1 clinical trial in August. This trial involved 131 Australians across two trial sites (Melbourne and Brisbane). In addition, approximately 690 Australians have participated in the Phase 2 arm of the clinical trial, which has been conducted across up to 40 sites in Australia and the U.S.

The planned global Phase 3 clinical programs evaluating NVX-CoV2373 will assess immunity, safety and COVID-19 disease prevention. The trials seek to recruit members of the community most vulnerable to COVID-19 – the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions as well as diverse racial and ethnic representation.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVX-CoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and cannot replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated induction of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. NVX-CoV2373 is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in the UK and two ongoing Phase 2 studies that began in August; a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, and a Phase 1/2 continuation in the U.S. and Australia. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $388 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

About Matrix-M™

Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response.

About Manufacturing

Novavax is progressing large-scale manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 across multiple locations around the world. Delivery of initial doses of the vaccine is expected as early as the end of this year, with the goal to expand the production to enable delivery of over 2 billion doses annually, once all production is online.

51707,Coloplast Acquires Nine Continents Medical,"Coloplast acquires Nine Continents Medical, Inc.","Coloplast has acquired implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) treatment developer Nine Continents Medical for $145M upfront and an additional contingent milestone. ITNS is developed for overactive bladder (OAB)
 Coloplast expected to initiate clinical studies of ITNS in 2021 with the goal to obtain pre-market approval for a Class III device in the US and EU market approvals in the 2024-2025 timeframe
 ITNS is a miniaturized, self-powered unit placed in the lower leg in a short, minimally invasive procedure under local anesthesia. The unit does not require patient activation, recharging, or recurring visits to the doctor and works on the clinically proven MoA of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation","Coloplast announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Nine Continents Medical, Inc., an early stage company pioneering an implantable tibial nerve stimulation treatment for over-active bladder. The acquisition price consists of USD 145 million upfront cash payment and an additional contingent future milestone payment.

Founded in 2014, Nine Continents Medical, Inc. is a privately held company that has developed an innovative solution for over-active bladder (OAB), a condition characterized by a range of symptoms including the need to urinate more frequently, increased urgency, incontinence or leakage, and a need to urinate at night. The device is an implantable tibial nerve stimulator (ITNS), a miniaturized, self-powered unit placed in the lower leg under local anesthesia during a short, minimally invasive procedure. The solution requires no patient activation, recharging or recurring doctor visits, and builds on the clinically proven mode of action of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, which is an OAB treatment available on the market today.

Coloplast’s ambition is that clinical studies will demonstrate that patients receiving this solution can live a more normal life with significantly reduced symptoms. Coloplast expects to begin pivotal studies in 2021, with the ambition to obtain pre-market approval for a Class III device in the US and EU market approvals in the 2024-2025 timeframe.

Today, +80 million people globally suffer from OAB symptoms. About 40% of the OAB patient population seek treatment and of those about 3 million patients globally are candidates for 3rd line therapies like the solution developed by Nine Continents.

The acquisition of Nine Continents and entry into the OAB segment fits with Coloplast’s strategy to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the Interventional Urology business and aligns with Coloplast’s mission and strategic direction to bring innovative solutions to the market.

“I am excited about the prospects of the Nine Continents device and pleased to confirm our commitment to the Interventional Urology business with this acquisition in the large OAB market. There is a large group of patients in the US and abroad suffering from OAB, and with Nine Continents’ innovative, minimally invasive device we hope to help these people live a better life,” says Kristian Villumsen, President and CEO of Coloplast.
The acquisition is debt financed using existing credit facilities, and Coloplast’s dividend policy is unchanged. The acquisition has no impact on Coloplast’s long-term guidance of 7-9% organic growth p.a. and more than 30% EBIT margin in constant currencies. Operational costs until commercialization are included in Coloplast’s annual incremental commercial investments of up to 2% of revenues.

51727,Merck to Acquire VelosBio for $2.75B,Merck to Acquire VelosBio,"Merck will acquire all the outstanding shares of VelosBio for $2.75B in cash. The transaction is expected to be closed by the end of 2020
 The acquisition will bolster Merck’s oncology pipeline with the addition of VelosBio’s VLS-101, which is an investigational ADC targeting ROR1 to treat hematological malignancies and solid tumors
 In Oct’2020, VelosBio has initiated P-II study to evaluate VLS-101 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, including patients with TNBC, HR+/HER2+ BC, and NSCLC. Additionally, VelosBio is developing a preclinical pipeline of ADCs and bispecific Abs targeting ROR1 to complement VLS-101 by offering alternative methods of tumor cell killing","KENILWORTH, N.J. & SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and VelosBio Inc. today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of VelosBio for $2.75 billion in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. VelosBio is a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing first-in-class cancer therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). VelosBio’s lead investigational candidate is VLS-101, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting ROR1 that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, respectively.

“At Merck, we continue to bolster our growing oncology pipeline with strategic acquisitions that both complement our current portfolio and strengthen our long-term growth potential,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Pioneering work by VelosBio scientists has yielded VLS-101, which in early studies has provided notable evidence of activity in heavily pretreated patients with refractory hematological malignancies, including mantel cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.”

In October 2020, VelosBio announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04504916) to evaluate VLS-101 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, including patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor-positive and/or HER2-positive breast cancer, and non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In early clinical trials, VLS-101 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and early signs of anti-tumor activity. Results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, to be presented virtually at the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (Dec. 5-8, 2020), showed that VLS-101 resulted in objective clinical responses, including complete responses, in 47% (n=7/15) of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 80% (n=4/5) of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients in this Phase 1 trial had been heavily pretreated with other anticancer medications, and their cancers had failed to respond or had relapsed after initially responding to these other anticancer medications. In addition, VelosBio is developing a preclinical pipeline of next-generation ADCs and bispecific antibodies targeting ROR1 with the potential to complement VLS-101 by offering alternative methods of tumor cell killing.

“Merck is a recognized leader in oncology, and this acquisition reflects the hard work and commitment of all the employees at VelosBio in advancing the science of ROR1,” said Dave Johnson, founder and chief executive officer at VelosBio. “We are very pleased that Merck has recognized the value of our first-in-class ROR1-directed investigational therapeutics. As part of Merck’s oncology pipeline, our lead product candidate, VLS-101, is now well positioned to achieve its maximum potential to benefit appropriate cancer patients in need.”

The closing of the transaction, which is subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions, is expected by the end of 2020.

Merck was represented by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP as legal advisor and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as financial advisor. VelosBio was represented by Cooley LLP as legal advisor and Centerview Partners LLC as financial advisor.

About VLS-101

VLS-101 is an investigational ADC comprising a monoclonal antibody targeting ROR1 that is linked to a chemotherapeutic agent called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). After the antibody binds to ROR1 on cancer cells, the ADC is designed to enter those cells and release MMAE to destroy the cancer cells. In mouse models of human hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, VLS-101 showed robust antitumor activity. VLS-101 is in clinical development for patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted VLS-101 orphan drug and fast track designations for the treatment of MCL.

51744,AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receives EC's Approval for Heart Failure,Forxiga approved in the EU for heart failure,"The approval is based on P-III DAPA-HF study involves assessing of Forxiga (10mg) + SOC vs PBO +SOC in 4744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%) with/out T2D
 Results: reduction in risk of the composite outcome by 26%, with both components of the 1EPs (first occurrence of a worsening HF event or CV death) contributed benefit to the overall effect.
 Forxiga is the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved in the EU for HFrEF in adult patients with/out T2D. The therapy is currently being evaluated for HFpEF in P-III DELIVER study with its anticipated results in H2’21","AstraZeneca’s Forxiga (dapagliflozin) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D).

Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening chronic disease that prevents the heart from pumping sufficient levels of blood around the body. It affects 15 million people in the EU, at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction,1-3 which occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore expels less oxygen-rich blood into the body.4-6

The approval by the European Commission is based on positive results from the landmark DAPA-HF Phase III trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine.7 It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency.

John McMurray, MD, Cardiovascular Research Centre, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK, said: “Today’s approval provides physicians with a completely novel treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, not only improving symptoms and reducing hospital admissions, but also increasing survival in this life-threatening condition.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “With this approval of Forxiga, we can redefine the standard of care for millions of people in the EU living with heart failure. We are another step closer to achieving our ambition of preventing or treating heart failure by providing a treatment that can significantly reduce cardiovascular death and hospitalisation.”

Forxiga is the first sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to have shown a statistically significant reduction in the risk of the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death or worsening of HF events, including hospitalisation for HF (hHF). The DAPA-HF Phase III trial demonstrated that Forxiga, in addition to standard of care, reduced the risk of the composite outcome versus placebo by 26% and both components of the primary composite endpoint contributed benefit to the overall effect. In the DAPA-HF Phase III trial, the safety profile of Forxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine. During the trial, one CV death or hHF or an urgent visit associated with HF could be avoided for every 21 patients treated.


Forxiga (known as Farxiga in the US) is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with HFrEF and is currently under review in Japan and in several over countries around the world.

Forxiga is advancing cardiorenal prevention as science continues to identify the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas. DAPA-HF is part of DapaCare, a robust clinical trial programme to assess the potential CV and renal benefits of Forxiga. The programme has also explored the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD Phase III trial. Additionally, Forxiga is currently being tested for HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the DELIVER Phase III trial with data anticipated in the second half of 2021.

Heart failure

HF affects approximately 64 million people worldwide (at least half of whom have a reduced ejection fraction), including 15 million in the EU and six million in the US.2-3,8 It is a chronic disease where half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis.9 There are two main categories of HF related to ejection fraction (EF), a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts: HFrEF and HFpEF.7 HFrEF occurs when the left ventricle muscle is not able to contract adequately and therefore, expels less oxygen-rich blood in to the body.5,6 HF remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers in both men (prostate and bladder cancers) and women (breast cancer).10 It is the leading cause of hospitalisation for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.11

DAPA-HF

DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure) is an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised, double-blinded Phase III trial in 4,744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%), with and without T2D, designed to evaluate the effect of Forxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint was time to the first occurrence of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalisation or equivalent event; i.e. an urgent heart failure visit), or cardiovascular death. The median duration of follow-up was 18.2 months.

Forxiga

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction.

Forxiga has been evaluated in patients with CKD in the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial, with the full results announced in August 2020 demonstrating that Forxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints, providing overwhelming efficacy. Forxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) Phase III trials. Forxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking, registry-based randomised controlled trial. Forxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

51754,AstraZeneca and MSD's Lynparza (olaparib) Receive EU's Approval as 1L Maintenance Treatment for HRD-Positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza approved in the EU as 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer,"The approval is based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of P-III PAOLA-1 study assessing Lynparza + bevacizumab vs bevacizumab alone as 1L maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous/ endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal cancer who had CR/PR to 1L treatment with Pt. based CT and bevacizumab
 Results: reduction in risk of disease progression or death by 67%, PFS (37.2mos. vs 17.7mos.); PFS2 (50.3mos. vs 35.3mos.)
 Following the approval, AZ will receive $25M as a regulatory milestone from MSD. The approval follows the CHMP’s positive opinion granted in Sept’2020","AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza (olaparib) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab of patients with homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the EU and the five-year survival rate is approximately 45%, due partly because women are often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV).1-3

The approval by the European Commission was based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial which showed Lynparza, in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment, demonstrated a substantial progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus bevacizumab alone for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer. It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in September 2020.

Isabelle Ray-Coquard, principal investigator of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial and medical oncologist, Centre Léon Bérard and President of the GINECO group, Paris, France, said: “For women with advanced ovarian cancer, the goal of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent of achieving long-term remission. Unfortunately, once a patient’s cancer recurs, it historically has been incurable. Lynparza together with bevacizumab has demonstrated an impressive median progression-free survival benefit of more than three years and is poised to become the standard of care for eligible patients with HRD-positive tumours in the EU.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Half of all newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer have HRD-positive tumours. Women treated with Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab in the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial lived progression free for a median of more than three years, showing that HRD testing should be an essential component of clinical diagnosis. HRD status can help physicians select a personalised 1st-line treatment regimen for patients to substantially delay relapse in this devastating disease.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Biomarker testing has rapidly enhanced our understanding of how PARP inhibition can help target this disease. The EU approval reinforces that HRD-positive tumours represent a distinct subset of advanced ovarian cancer and HRD testing is critical for women in this setting.”

The PAOLA-1 Phase III trial showed that Lynparza, in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio of 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.45). The addition of Lynparza improved PFS to a median of 37.2 months versus 17.7 with bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer. The data from the PAOLA-1 trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2019.

Further results recently presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2020 showed a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint of the time to second disease progression (PFS2). Lynparza with bevacizumab provided benefit beyond first disease progression, improving PFS2 to a median of 50.3 months versus 35.3 with bevacizumab alone.

The full EU indication is for Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated with HRD positive status defined by either a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation and/or genomic instability.

Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is approved in the US and in several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer and is currently under regulatory review in other countries around the world.

Financial considerations

Following this approval for Lynparza in the EU, AstraZeneca will receive a regulatory milestone payment from MSD of $25m, anticipated to be booked as collaboration revenue during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Ovarian cancer

In 2018, there were nearly 68,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the EU and around 45,000 deaths.3  Approximately 50% of ovarian cancers are HRD-positive including BRCA1/2 mutation.4,5 Approximately 15% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1/2 mutation.6  The primary aim of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent to achieve long-term remission.7-9

Homologous recombination deficiency

HRD, which defines a subgroup of ovarian cancer, encompasses a wide range of genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations and beyond. As with BRCA gene mutations, HRD interferes with normal cell DNA repair mechanisms and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors including Lynparza.10

PAOLA-1

PAOLA-1 is a double-blinded Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of Lynparza added to standard-of-care bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone, as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1st-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. AstraZeneca and MSD announced in August 2019 that the trial met its primary endpoint of PFS in the overall trial population.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer (BRCAm and/or genomic instability). Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US, the EU and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (BRCAm and other HRR gene mutations). Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology. Based in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

51777,AstraZeneca's Brilinta (ticagrelor) Receives the US FDA's Approval to Reduce the Risk of Stroke in Patients with an Acute Ischemic Stroke or High-Risk Transient Ischemic Attack,Brilinta approved in the US to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with an acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk transient ischaemic attack,"The approval is based on P-III THALES study involves assessing Brilinta (180mg as a loading dose followed by 90mg, bid) + aspirin vs aspirin as monothx. in 11,000 patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA for 30days
 Results demonstrated a reduction in the rate of the composite 1EP of stroke & death by 17%, risk of severe bleeding events (0.5% vs 0.1%). Regulatory submissions to expand the approved indication are under regulatory review in China and the EU
 Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. The approval follows the US FDA’s PR designation granted in Jul’2020","AstraZeneca’s Brilinta (ticagrelor) has been approved in the US to reduce the risk of stroke, a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤5) or high-risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

The approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on positive results from the THALES Phase III trial that showed aspirin plus Brilinta 90mg significantly reduced the rate of the composite of stroke and death compared to aspirin alone in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or TIA.1 The decision follows the Priority Review designation granted by the FDA in July 2020.

Dr. Clay Johnston, lead investigator for the THALES Phase III trial and Dean of the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas in Austin, US, said: “One in four patients who have had a stroke will experience a second one, with the risk particularly high within the first 30 days. The approval of Brilinta in combination with aspirin is an important advancement to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and much-awaited good news for physicians and patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds and the impact on a person’s life can be truly devastating. Brilinta is a well-established medicine across patients with coronary artery disease and with today’s approval, we can now expand its potential to patients with an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.”

The THALES trial demonstrated that Brilinta 90mg used twice daily and taken with daily aspirin for 30 days, reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (absolute risk reduction = 1.1%; hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.96, p=0.015), compared to aspirin alone in patients with an acute ischemic stroke or TIA.1 This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction. The primary composite endpoint was driven by a reduction in stroke.

The risk for severe bleeding events was 0.5% in patients receiving aspirin plus Brilinta and 0.1% for aspirin alone. The results were in line with the known safety profile of Brilinta.1 Full data from the THALES Phase III trial can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Regulatory submissions to expand the approved indication are also under regulatory review in China and in the EU where the medicine’s name is Brilique.

Brilinta is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients who are at high-risk and have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the US FDA approved a new indication for Brilinta to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

Stroke

An ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage cutting off the blood supply to a region of the brain. A transient ischaemic attack, is a temporary blockage of the blood supply to a region of the brain, resulting in symptoms only lasting for a short amount of time. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide.2 In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds, and every four minutes, someone dies of stroke.3 About one in four strokes are recurrent, with the risk particularly high within 30 days after the initial event and even higher when looking at time periods closer to the initial event.4,5

THALES

THALES is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven Phase III trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus Brilinta is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and treated for 30 days. Study treatments were Brilinta 180mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2-30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300-325mg on day 1, followed by 75-100mg once daily on days 2-30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention.

Brilinta

Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. Brilinta, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (heart attack, stroke or CV death), in patients with ACS or a history of heart attack. In the US, Brilinta is also indicated for the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

About Aducanumab

Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data from patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

About Aducanumab’s Clinical Program

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. Enrolled patients had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the MMSE, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

PRIME was a Phase 1b randomized, multicenter study that included a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a dose-blinded long-term extension period. Enrolled patients had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with MMSE scores of 20-30. The safety and tolerability of aducanumab was the primary aim of the study. Secondary outcomes were: (1) the effect of aducanumab on brain amyloid plaque content as measured by [18F]-florbetapir PET, (2) the pharmacokinetics of aducanumab and (3) the immunogenicity of aducanumab. Clinical efficacy endpoints were prespecified in the study protocol as exploratory.

About Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

51818,Eisai Reports Results of Lenvima (lenvatinib) + Everolimus in P-II 218 Study for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,Eisai Announces New Investigational Data Evaluating TKI-mTOR Inhibitor Regimen LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Plus Everolimus in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) at IKCS 2020,"The P-II 218 study involves assessing Lenvima (14mg, qd) + everolimus (5mg, qd) vs Lenvima (18mg, qd) + everolimus (5mg qd) in patients with clear-cell RCC, following treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy, with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy permitted
 In the primary analysis, @24wks. ORR (32.1% vs 34.8%) i.e. lower dose did not meet the threshold for non-inferiority; Grade 2/ any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs (82.8% vs 79.6%); discontinuation (32.4% vs 26.8%); dose interruption (74.6% vs 83.3%); dose reductions (67.6% vs 69.6%)
 Overall ORR (34.6% vs 40.6%); mPFS (11.1 vs 14.7mos.); m-OS (27.0 vs NE). Results were presented at IKCS 2020","WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Nov. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eisai announced results from Study 218, a Phase 2 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of two different starting doses (18 mg versus 14 mg once daily) of LENVIMA, an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, plus everolimus (5 mg once daily) in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy, with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy permitted, during an oral presentation at the International Kidney Cancer Symposium (IKCS) 2020. Results indicate that the lower starting dose (14 mg) of LENVIMA did not meet the threshold for non-inferiority compared to the FDA-approved starting dose (18 mg).

“With the influx of options for patients in the advanced RCC space, it is important that we continue to evaluate data in order to determine the most effective course of action that may help maximize therapeutic effects while managing tolerability for patients,” said Sumanta Pal, MD, Co-director of the Kidney Cancer Program and clinical professor, Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, Calif., and lead investigator of the study. “The results from Study 218 show the potential benefit of LENVIMA plus everolimus in patients with advanced RCC, while providing a similar safety profile seen in previous studies.”

The objective of this randomized, open-label, Phase 2 trial (NCT03173560) was to assess whether a starting dose of LENVIMA 14 mg once daily plus everolimus 5 mg once daily would provide similar efficacy with an improved safety profile compared to the FDA-approved dosage of LENVIMA 18 mg once daily plus everolimus 5 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was noninferiority of LENVIMA 14 mg versus 18 mg for objective response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (ORRWK24) (odds ratio: >0.76; P-value: ≤ 0.045) based on investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The primary safety endpoint was superiority of the proportion of patients with intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 24 weeks after randomization in the 14 mg versus 18 mg treatment arms. Some key secondary endpoints included overall ORR, progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS) and safety. The study enrolled 343 patients.

In the primary efficacy analysis (n=311 patients), ORR at week 24 for patients treated with LENVIMA at the lower starting dose (14 mg) was not non-inferior to ORR at week 24 for patients treated with the approved starting dose (18 mg) (odds ratioORRWK24: 0.88 [90% CI: 0.59-1.32]; P-value: 0.2676). ORR at Week 24 for patients starting with 14 mg and 18 mg was 32.1% (95% CI: 24.7-39.4) and 34.8% (95% CI: 27.3-42.3), respectively. In the primary safety analysis (n=309), the occurrence of intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs was similar between the 14 mg and 18 mg treatment arms: 82.8% vs. 79.6% (P-value: 0.4763), respectively. The 18 mg starting dose of LENVIMA plus everolimus 5 mg demonstrated a similar safety profile as seen in a previous Phase 2 trial (Study 205). In the full safety analysis set (all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug, n=341), TEAEs led to:

discontinuation in 32.4% vs. 26.8% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively;
dose interruption in 74.6% vs. 83.3% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively; and
dose reductions in 67.6% vs. 69.6% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 18 mg, respectively.
Overall ORR (based on the primary efficacy analysis set of n=311) for patients starting with 14 mg and 18 mg of LENVIMA was 34.6% (95% CI: 27.1-42.1) and 40.6% (95% CI: 32.9-48.4), respectively (odds ratio: 0.77 [90% CI: 0.52-1.14]). Median PFS and median OS indicated a numerical benefit for patients treated with LENVIMA at 18 mg compared to LENVIMA at 14 mg:

Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 9.0-12.9) for patients treated with 14 mg vs. 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1-20.3) for patients treated with 18 mg; and
Median OS was 27.0 months (95% CI: 18.3-NE) for patients treated with 14 mg vs. NE (95% CI: 23.8-NE) for patients treated with 18 mg.
Some of the most common any-grade TEAEs (≥ 20%) across the 14 mg and 18 mg treatment arms included diarrhea (68.2% vs. 72.0%), hypertension (30.1% vs. 35.7%), proteinuria (22.5% vs. 35.7%), decreased appetite (35.3% vs. 34.5%), and nausea (30.6% vs. 31.0%). Serious TEAEs (≥ 2%) occurred in 49.1% of patients who received LENVIMA 14 mg and 48.8% of patients who received LENVIMA 18 mg.

“This research demonstrates our commitment to advancing our understanding of our oncology compounds and generates key insights for the medical community to help inform treatment decisions around dosing,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Vice President of Clinical Research for the Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “This study, in which 343 patients received LENVIMA plus everolimus, helps to contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of this TKI-mTOR combination in the advanced RCC treatment paradigm.”

Study 218 was conducted as a post-marketing commitment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) following priority review designation (in the U.S.) and approval of LENVIMA plus everolimus for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who were previously treated with an anti-angiogenic therapy. LENVIMA is marketed as KISPLYX® in the European Union and Switzerland for this indication.

In March 2018, Eisai and Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), through an affiliate, entered into a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of LENVIMA.

About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 403,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 175,000 deaths from the disease in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with RCC will have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and as many as 40% will develop metastases after primary surgical treatment for localized RCC. Survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, and with a 5-year survival rate of 12% for metastatic disease, the prognosis for these patients is poor.

About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Capsules

LENVIMA is indicated:

For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-refractory DTC)
In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy
For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy, and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial
LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Hypertension. In DTC, hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC, hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC, hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC.

Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity

Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.

Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1,327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.

Monitor liver function prior to initiation, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Renal Failure or Impairment. Serious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment was reported in 14% and 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, respectively. Grade 3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 2% of patients with HCC, including 1 fatal event in each study. In RCC, renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (10% grade 3).

Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity.

Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC, proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in DTC and HCC, respectively. In RCC, proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.

QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%.

Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.

Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus– treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome. Across clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.

Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.

Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.

Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Embryo-fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.

The data presented at the 2020 fall Conference of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases on 5th November 2020, demonstrated promising safety, tolerability, antiviral effect, and efficacy profile of CT-P59 in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.

The global Phase I clinical trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel-group trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral effect of CT-P59. The trial enrolled 18 patients with mild symptoms of SARS-COV-2 infection who were randomised into three cohorts in which 15 patients received CT-P59 at 20mg/kg, 40mg/kg or 80mg/kg respectively, or matching placebo (3 patients).

The results indicate that the patient population treated with CT-P59 experienced about 44% reduced mean clinical recovery time in comparison to the average placebo recovery time. None of the patients treated with CT-P59 required hospitalisation or antiviral therapy as a result of COVID-19. No significant treatment-emergent serious adverse events or clinically significant treatment-emergent adverse events were identified at the interim stage.

“This is positive and encouraging efficacy and safety data showing accelerated recovery time in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19,” said Professor Jin Yong Kim, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Incheon Medical Centre. “I look forward to the possibility of further promising data from ongoing phase II/III studies building on the positive results seen in this study.”

About COVID-191,2

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that lead to illnesses from the common cold to severe diseases. Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the disease COVID-19, this new strain, discovered in 2019, is behind the ongoing pandemic outbreak.

The most common signs of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough and tiredness; however, people may also experience other symptoms including shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Most people infected with the virus will exhibit mild to moderate symptoms however older people, and those with existing underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more likely to develop a more severe form of COVID-19.

Please find up to date information about the outbreak via the World Health Organization at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1

About CT-P59

CT-P59 was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates and selecting those that showed the highest potency in neutralising the SARS-CoV-2 virus including the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant). In pre-clinical data the treatment candidate demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, as well as a reduction in lung inflammation.3

51861,Novartis' Ilaris (canakinumab) Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoints in P-lll Study for COVID-19 Pneumonia and CRS,Novartis provides update on CAN-COVID trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS),"The P-lll CAN-COVID trial involves assessing Ilaris (canakinumab) + SOC vs PBO + SoC in 454 patients aged 18-98yrs. with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome CRS, with its expected full results in early 2021
 Result: The trial fails to meet its 1EPs of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation up to day29 (88.8% vs 85.7%) and did not meet its 2EPs of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 wks. (4.9% vs 7.2%)
 Canakinumab is mAb that binds to and neutralizes (IL-1β), blocking its action. Additionally, P-III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by end of 2020","Basel, November 6, 2020 — Novartis today announced new data from an interim analysis for the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAN-COVID trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. The ongoing trial failed to meet its primary endpoint showing that treatment with canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) did not demonstrate a significantly greater chance of survival for patients without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, compared with placebo plus SoC up to Day 291. The trial did not meet its key secondary endpoint of reducing the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after treatment1. The safety profiles of canakinumab plus SoC and placebo plus SoC were comparable1.

“Though the CAN-COVID trial did not show the patient benefit we were hoping for, it helps improve the scientific understanding of COVID-19 and the role of interleukin-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “There’s still an urgent need for effective ways to combat COVID-19 and we will continue to apply our best scientific minds in support of the global pandemic response, including a Phase III trial of ruxolitinib. We’re deeply grateful to the patients who participated and their caregivers, as well as the healthcare professionals and hospital staff who made this research possible while fighting the pandemic on the front line.”

In the trial, the primary endpoint of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation was 88.8% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 85.7% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.29)1. The key secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 weeks was 4.9% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 7.2% for placebo plus SoC (P=0.33)1. Both the primary and key secondary endpoints trended in favor of canakinumab but did not reach statistical significance1. No new safety signals for canakinumab were identified1.

This interim analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. The CAN-COVID results do not affect any other ongoing trials for canakinumab, including investigations for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7-9.

As part of its continued efforts to support the global pandemic response, Novartis in October announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-194. In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end5.

About CAN-COVID
CAN-COVID is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)6. Patients were hypoxic but not requiring intubation or invasive mechanical ventilation6. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab plus SoC vs placebo plus SoC in increasing the chance of survival without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation up to Day 296. The key secondary endpoint was to reduce the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after trial treatment6. The trial enrolled 454 patients at multiple centers across the US, Russia and Europe1. Both endpoints were analyzed at Day 296. The average age of trial participants was 58 years old, ranging from 18 to 98 years old1. Approximately 30% were Hispanic or Latino, 16% were Black or African American and 4% were Asian1. Interim analysis of Day 29 results is available. The trial is ongoing (to Day 127) with full results expected in early 20216.

About canakinumab
Canakinumab is biologic medicine used in the treatment of a number of rare, debilitating auto-inflammatory diseases, for which there are limited options available. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), blocking its action2,3,10. Excessive production of IL-1β plays a prominent role in certain inflammatory diseases and immune responses11,12. Canakinumab is an established medicine approved under the trade name Ilaris® in approximately 60 countries including the US, Europe and others. It is indicated for rare conditions including periodic fever syndromes, adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA)2,3. First approved in 2009, canakinumab has been proven to be highly effective and well tolerated as a treatment option for its approved indications based on previously reported clinical trials2,3. As well as being studied in severe COVID-19, canakinumab is also being investigated for the treatment of a number of other diseases involving inflammation, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)7–9.

Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic
Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)13. Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines4. We continue with the Phase III trial for ruxolitinib, another Novartis medicine, in collaboration with Incyte5. Preliminary results from this trial are expected by year end. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-1914, 15. In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia13. Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID16.

51875,AstraZeneca's Calquence (acalabrutinib) Receives EU's Approval for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia,Calquence approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The approval is based on P-lll ELEVATE-TN study assessing Calquence + obinutuzumab or Calquence alone vs obinutuzumab + CT in patients with previously untreated CLL and ASCEND study assessing Calquence vs rituximab + idelalisib/ bendamustine in patients with r/r CLL
 ELEVATE-TN results: a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (90% and 80%). ASCEND results: patients remained alive and free from disease progression @12mos. (88% vs 68%)
 Calquence is a selective inhibitor of BTK, binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity. The approval follows CHMP’s recommendation received in Jul’2020","AstraZeneca’s Calquence (acalabrutinib), a next-generation selective Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common type of leukaemia in adults.

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from two Phase III clinical trials, ELEVATE-TN in patients with previously untreated CLL and ASCEND in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.1,2 This follows a recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in July 2020.

Paolo Ghia, MD, Director, Strategic Research Program on CLL, Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, and investigator of the ASCEND Phase III trial, said: “One of our biggest hurdles in treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is finding tolerable treatment options that manage the disease long term, which typically impacts older patients with comorbidities. Today’s news marks great progress for patients in Europe, as the Phase III clinical trials for Calquence showed a significant improvement in comparison with current standard treatments.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “This approval represents a key development for patients in Europe who until now have had limited chemotherapy-free treatment options. As our first European approval in blood cancers, Calquence provides a new tolerable treatment option with uncompromised efficacy and the potential to positively impact the quality of life for thousands of patients living with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.”

In the ELEVATE-TN Phase III trial, Calquence combined with obinutuzumab and as monotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 90% and 80%, respectively, compared with standard chemo-immunotherapy treatment chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, in patients with previously untreated CLL.1 In the ASCEND Phase III trial, 88% of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL taking Calquence remained alive and free from disease progression after 12 months compared with 68% of patients on rituximab combined with idelalisib or bendamustine.2 Data from the interim results of the trials were published in The Lancet and Journal of Clinical Oncology, respectively.

Calquence is approved for the treatment of CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma in the US and is approved for CLL in several other countries worldwide. Calquence is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries. Calquence is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Europe.

As part of a broad development programme, Calquence is being assessed in more than 20 AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical trials for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), follicular lymphoma (FL), and other haematologic malignancies.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 105,000 new cases globally in 2016, and the number of people living with CLL is expected to grow with improved treatment as patients live longer with the disease.3,4,5,6 In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections. As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This could result in anaemia, infection, and bleeding.4 B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

ELEVATE-TN

ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) was a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Calquence in combination with obinutuzumab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, or Calquence alone versus chlorambucil, a chemotherapy, in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated patients with CLL. Patients 65 years of age or older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale >6 or creatinine clearance of 30 to 69mL/min, were enrolled. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received Calquence (100mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).1

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the Calquence and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS in the Calquence monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints included objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival (OS).1

ASCEND

ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) was a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of Calquence in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). Patients in the second arm received investigator’s choice of either rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, in combination with idelalisib, a PI3K inhibitor, or rituximab in combination with bendamustine, a chemotherapy.2

The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by an IRC, and key secondary endpoints included physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate and duration of response, as well as OS, patient-reported outcomes and time to next treatment.2

Calquence

Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.7,8 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.7

As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquence in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, DLBCL, WM, FL, and other haematologic malignancies.

AstraZeneca in haematology

Leveraging its strength in oncology, AstraZeneca has established haematology as one of four key oncology disease areas of focus. The Company’s haematology franchise includes two medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and a robust global development programme for a broad portfolio of potential blood cancer treatments. Acerta Pharma serves as AstraZeneca’s haematology research and development arm. AstraZeneca partners with like-minded science-led companies to advance the discovery and development of therapies to address unmet need.

51882,Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2 Demonstrates 90% Efficacy in Preventing COVID-19,PFIZER AND BIONTECH ANNOUNCE VACCINE CANDIDATE AGAINST COVID-19 ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN FIRST INTERIM ANALYSIS FROM PHASE 3 STUDY,"The BNT162b2 showed more than 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first interim efficacy analysis, conducted on Nov 8, 2020 from P-III clinical study
 The companies reported no serious safety concerns so far while safety and additional efficacy data continues to be collected. The company expect to seek US’ EUA in the third week of Nov’2020
 The companies will continue the clinical trial for final analysis at 164 confirmed cases in order to collect further data and characterize the vaccine candidate’s performance against other study endpoints and plan to submit data from the full P-I trial for scientific peer-review publication","NEW YORK & MAINZ, GERMANY–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study.

After discussion with the FDA, the companies recently elected to drop the 32-case interim analysis and conduct the first interim analysis at a minimum of 62 cases. Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.

“Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen. With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”After discussion with the FDA, the companies recently elected to drop the 32-case interim analysis and conduct the first interim analysis at a minimum of 62 cases. Upon the conclusion of those discussions, the evaluable case count reached 94 and the DMC performed its first analysis on all cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.

“I want to thank the thousands of people who volunteered to participate in the clinical trial, our academic collaborators and investigators at the study sites, and our colleagues and collaborators around the world who are dedicating their time to this crucial endeavor,” added Bourla. “We could not have come this far without the tremendous commitment of everyone involved.”

“The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said Prof. Ugur Sahin, BioNTech co-founder and CEO. “When we embarked on this journey 10 months ago this is what we aspired to achieve. Especially today, while we are all in the midst of a second wave and many of us in lockdown, we appreciate even more how important this milestone is on our path towards ending this pandemic and for all of us to regain a sense of normality. We will continue to collect further data as the trial continues to enroll for a final analysis planned when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this important achievement possible.”

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will include, with the approval of the FDA, new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose as well. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus.

Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose.

Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced.

Based on current projections we expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.

 Patients showed reduced viral load & rates of symptoms & hospitalization. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions
 The US government will allocate 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab to high-risk patients, with no out-of-pocket costs for the medication. Bamlanivimab should be administered asap after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset","INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg. Bamlanivimab is authorized for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Bamlanivimab should be administered as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset. The authorization allows for the distribution and emergency use of bamlanivimab, which is administered via a single intravenous infusion.

“This emergency authorization allows us to make bamlanivimab available as a COVID-19 treatment for recently diagnosed, high-risk patients – adding a valuable tool for doctors fighting the now-increasing burden of this global pandemic,” said David A. Ricks, Lilly’s chairman and CEO. “The rapid development and availability of bamlanivimab could not have been achieved without the relentless work of our Lilly team, collaboration across the industry and the urgent work being done by the government to ensure appropriate allocation to patients who need it the most.”

The EUA is based on data from BLAZE-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Patients treated with bamlanivimab showed reduced viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalization. In BLAZE-1, frequency and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. Infusion reactions and other allergic hypersensitivity events have been reported. The EUA includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions.

“The BLAZE-1 data show bamlanivimab, when given early in the disease course, may help patients clear the virus and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations, supporting our belief that neutralizing antibodies can be an important therapeutic option for patients fighting this virus,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We’re proud of the speed with which we have been able to bring patients this therapy specifically designed to treat COVID-19. We thank those who have contributed to this medical advancement, particularly the clinical trial investigators and participants around the country.”

The FDA grants emergency use authorization to provide availability of a medicine that may help diagnose, treat or prevent a life-threatening disease when no adequate and approved alternatives are available. This use of bamlanivimab is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The authorization is temporary and does not replace the formal review and approval process. Bamlanivimab remains an investigational drug and has not been approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA). Evaluation of its safety and efficacy is ongoing across a range of patient populations impacted by COVID-19. Data from these studies will be used to support a future BLA submission involving bamlanivimab.

Lilly will begin shipping bamlanivimab immediately to AmerisourceBergen, a national distributor, which will distribute it as directed by the U.S. government’s allocation program. For the most up-to-date information regarding access to bamlanivimab, patients should speak with their health care providers, and health care providers should contact their state health department directly.

For more information about the use of bamlanivimab in COVID-19, contact Lilly’s 24-hour support line at 1-855-LillyC19 (1-855-545-5921).

Allocation flow of bamlanivimab in the U.S.
The U.S. government has purchased 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab and committed that Americans will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product’s administration.

The federal government is responsible for the appropriate allocation of bamlanivimab. Weekly allocation decisions will be proportionally based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state and territory over the previous seven days, based on data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Protect data collection platform. Each week, state and territorial health departments will select sites of care (that are accessible and can minimize infection transmission) to receive allocated doses and will provide AmerisourceBergen the list of sites. Sites of care will then confirm their need and AmerisourceBergen will distribute bamlanivimab overnight.

Global manufacturing and supply of bamlanivimab
To ensure rapid access of this treatment to patients around the world, Lilly has invested in large-scale manufacturing of bamlanivimab at risk – even before data demonstrated its potential to become a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19. Lilly has a robust, global supply chain in place to produce bamlanivimab, with numerous manufacturing sites worldwide.

Lilly anticipates manufacturing up to one million doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg by the end of 2020, for use around the world through early next year. Beginning in Q1 2021, the supply of Lilly’s antibody therapy is expected to increase substantially, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year.

Lilly is in discussions with global regulators to make bamlanivimab available around the world. Global allocation will be made based on Lilly’s guiding principles that aim to ensure access for patients with high unmet need, no matter where they live.

Important Information about bamlanivimab 
Bamlanivimab has not been approved by the FDA for any use.  It is not known if bamlanivimab is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19.

Bamlanivimab is authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of bamlanivimab under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Healthcare providers should review the Fact Sheet for information on the authorized use of bamlanivimab and mandatory requirements of the EUA. Please see the FDA Letter of Authorization, Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, and Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents, and Caregivers (English) (Spanish).

Authorized Use and Important Safety Information
Bamlanivimab is authorized for use under an EUA for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.

Limitations of Authorized Use

Bamlanivimab is not authorized for use in patients:
who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR
who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR
who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.
Benefit of treatment with bamlanivimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation with COVID-19.
Important Safety Information
There are limited clinical data available for bamlanivimab. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with bamlanivimab use.

Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions
There is a potential for serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, with administration of bamlanivimab. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Infusion-related reactions have been observed with administration of bamlanivimab. Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include:

fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, dizziness.
If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Limitations of Benefit and Potential Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19
Benefit of treatment with bamlanivimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.  Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation with COVID-19. See Limitations of Authorized Use.

Adverse Events
Adverse events reported in at least 1% of BLAZE-1 clinical trial participants on bamlanivimab 700 mg and placebo were Nausea (3% vs 4%), Diarrhea (1% vs 5%), Dizziness (3% vs 2%), Headache (3% vs 2%), Pruritus (2% vs 1%) and Vomiting (1% vs 3%).

Use in Specific Populations
Pregnancy
There are insufficient data on the use of bamlanivimab during pregnancy. Bamlanivimab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.

Breastfeeding
There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

About bamlanivimab
Bamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with a second antibody for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo.

The primary outcome measure for the completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll over 800 participants.

Data from the monotherapy arms of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

51901,Bayer Reports Regulatory Submission of Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) to the US and EU for CKD and T2D,Bayer submits marketing authorization applications for finerenone in the U.S. and the EU for patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes,"The MAA submitted to the EMA and the NDA to the US is based on P-III FIDELIO-DKD study assessing finerenone (10/20mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO in ~5,700 patients with CKD and T2D
 Result: reduction in the combined risk of time to kidney failure; a decrease of eGFR (≥ 40%) from baseline @4wks. or renal death by 18%, reduction in risk of 2EPs i.e. time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF by 14% over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6yrs.
 Finerenone is a selective MRA, being evaluated in FIGARO-DKD study in ~7,400 patients with CKD and T2D. Bayer has also initiated P-III FINEARTS-HF study of finerenone in symptomatic HF patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%","Berlin, November 9, 2020 – Bayer today announced the submission of regulatory applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of finerenone for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Finerenone is a first-in-class investigational non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that demonstrated renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD and T2D in the Phase III FIDELIO-DKD study.

“Despite recent advances in treatment, many patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes are still progressing to end-stage kidney failure or premature death,” said Professor George L. Bakris, MD, Department of Medicine, American Heart Association Comprehensive Hypertension Center, University of Chicago Medicine, USA and principal investigator of FIDELIO-DKD. “Finerenone works differently than current therapies and, if approved, provides a potential new treatment option to slow disease progression by directly targeting inflammation and fibrosis, major drivers of CKD progression.”

“With more than 160 million patients living with CKD and T2D, and the prevalence of T2D continuing to rise, CKD is a serious global health challenge that needs to be addressed,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. “These submissions are an important step towards our aim to providing finerenone to patients soon. The findings from the FIDELIO-DKD study demonstrated the effects of finerenone in improving outcomes in these patients by delaying CKD progression and reducing the risk for cardiovascular events, and we look forward to working with the regulatory bodies to hopefully make this treatment available to patients as soon as possible.”

The marketing authorization application (MAA) submitted to the EMA and the new drug application (NDA) submitted to the U.S. FDA were based on positive data from the FIDELIO-DKD study, which is part of the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D. Results from the trial were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) Kidney Week Reimagined 2020, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2020.

About Finerenone
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational novel, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that has been shown to block many of the harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation. MR overactivation is a major driver of kidney and cardiovascular damage through inflammatory and fibrotic processes.

The Phase III program with finerenone in CKD and T2D enrolled 13,000 patients across a broad range of disease severity including those with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. It is the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD and T2D and comprises two studies, evaluating the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, event-driven Phase III study that investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in comparison to placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of kidney failure and kidney disease progression in approximately 5,700 patients with CKD and T2D from more than 1,000 sites across 48 countries worldwide.
Finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily when added to standard of care, including blood glucose lowering therapies and a maximum tolerated dose of a RAS-blocking therapy such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), significantly reduced the combined risk of time to kidney failure, a sustained decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40% from baseline over a period of at least four weeks, or renal death by 18% (relative risk reduction; HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.93; p=0.0014]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years. Finerenone also significantly reduced the risk of the key secondary endpoint, a composite of time to cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo by 14% (relative risk reduction, HR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99; p=0.0339]) over a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 years. Finerenone was well-tolerated, which is consistent with the safety profile seen in previous studies with finerenone.

FIGARO-DKD (FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is still ongoing and is investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 7,400 patients with CKD and T2D across 47 countries including sites in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

About Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a deadly condition that is underrecognized. CKD is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 40% of all patients with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease. Despite guideline-directed therapies, patients with CKD and T2D remain at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events. It is estimated that CKD affects more than 160 million people with T2D worldwide. Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes is the main cause of end stage kidney disease which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. MR over-activation is known to trigger detrimental processes (e.g. inflammation and fibrosis) in kidneys and heart in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

51922,AstraZeneca and Amgen Report Results of Tezepelumab in P-III NAVIGATOR for Asthma,Tezepelumab NAVIGATOR Phase III trial met primary endpoint of a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations in a broad population of patients with severe asthma,"The P-III NAVIGATOR study involves assessing Tezepelumab + SOC vs PBO + SOC in adults (18–80yrs.) & adolescents (12–17yrs.) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium/high dose ICS + at least 1 additional controller medication with or without OCS
 Trial met its 1EPs i.e. reduction in AAER @52wks. in the overall population. The study also met 1EPs in patients with low levels of eosinophils i.e. <300 & 150 cells/microlitre
 Tezepelumab is mAb that inhibits the action of TSLP and has received US FDA’s BT designation in Sept’2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype","AstraZeneca and Amgen today announced positive results from the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial for the potential new medicine tezepelumab in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.

NAVIGATOR met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC) demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful1 reduction in the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo when added to SoC. SoC was medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS).

In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre the trial also met the primary endpoint, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microlitre.

Tezepelumab was very well tolerated in patients with severe asthma. Preliminary analyses show no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. Results from the NAVIGATOR trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

Severe asthma is a debilitating condition affecting approximately 34 million people worldwide.2.3 Many severe asthma patients continue to experience symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite the use of high-dose asthma controller medicines, currently available biologic therapies and OCS.3-5

Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow, Director of the Lung Division, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK, and principal investigator of the NAVIGATOR Phase III trial, said: “Due to the complex nature of severe asthma, many patients continue to face debilitating symptoms despite receiving standard of care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics. Today’s ground-breaking results show that tezepelumab has the potential to transform care for a broad population of severe asthma patients who are underserved today, including those without an eosinophilic phenotype.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Tezepelumab works differently from any other asthma biologic medicine and targets multiple inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma symptoms and exacerbations. Building on the broad efficacy previously seen with tezepelumab, these are exciting data that bring us one step closer to delivering a medicine to severe asthma patients, including those with low eosinophil counts.”

Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class medicine that blocks the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cytokine that plays a key role across the spectrum of asthma inflammation.6,7 NAVIGATOR is the first Phase III trial to show benefit in severe asthma by targeting TSLP.

The statistically significant and clinically meaningful exacerbation rate reductions demonstrated with tezepelumab in patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microlitre support the US Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted to tezepelumab in September 2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype. Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen (see AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration below).

Severe asthma

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide.2,3 Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma.3,4 Despite the use of inhaled asthma controller medicine, currently available biologic therapies and OCS, many severe asthma patients remain uncontrolled.3-5 Due to the complexity of severe asthma, many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.4,8,9

Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.3,5,10 Patients with severe asthma are at an increased risk of mortality and account for twice as many asthma-related hospitalisations.11-13 There is also a significant socio-economic burden, with these patients accounting for 50% of asthma-related costs.14

NAVIGATOR and the PATHFINDER clinical trial programme

Building on the Phase IIb PATHWAY trial, the Phase III PATHFINDER programme included two trials, NAVIGATOR and SOURCE.15,16 The programme includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials.

NAVIGATOR is a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS. The trial population included approximately equal proportions of patients with high (≥ 300 cells/µL) and low (< 300 cells/µL) blood eosinophil counts. The trial comprised a five to six week screening period, a 52-week treatment period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. All patients received their prescribed controller medications without change throughout the trial.15,17

The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate during the 52-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints included the effect of tezepelumab on lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life.15,17

SOURCE is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy. The primary endpoint is the categorised percentage reduction from baseline in the daily OCS dose, while not losing asthma control.16,18

Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase III extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy.19

Tezepelumab

Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.6,7 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.6,7 Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.7,20 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.7,20 Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients regardless of their type of inflammation.7,20

AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration

Earlier in 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialise tezepelumab; Amgen will record sales in the US and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada. AstraZeneca’s share of gross profits from tezepelumab in the US will be recognised as collaboration revenue. In all countries outside the US and Canada, AstraZeneca will solely commercialise tezepelumab. AstraZeneca will record all sales outside of the US as product sales and recognise Amgen’s share of gross profit as cost of sales.

51928,Novavax Receives the US FDA's Fast Track Designation for NVX-CoV2373 to Treat COVID-19,Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Granted Fast Track Designation by U.S. FDA,"The US FDA has granted FT designation to NVX-CoV2373 which is currently in late-phase clinical development. Novavax expects to initiate pivotal P-III study in the US & Mexico by the end of Nov’2020
 The company’s ongoing P-lll trial in the UK to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 is expected to be fully enrolled by the end of Nov. Depending on the overall COVID-19 attack rate, interim data in the UK trial is expected in Q1’21
 NVXCoV2373 is a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ nanoparticle technology and includes its proprietary MatrixM adjuvant","GAITHERSBURG, Md., Nov. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for NVX-CoV2373, the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Currently in late-phase clinical development, NVXCoV2373 is a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ nanoparticle technology and includes its proprietary MatrixM™ adjuvant.

“The FDA’s decision to grant Fast Track Designation for NVX-CoV2373 reflects the urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19, and we look forward to working closely with the agency to accelerate access to this vaccine,” said Gregory M. Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development, Novavax. “While the regulatory review of this clinical program will be expedited, Novavax remains committed to a data-driven and scientifically rigorous approach in demonstrating safety and efficacy, which we believe will support confidence in the vaccine in the U.S. and globally.”

Novavax expects to begin its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and Mexico by the end of November. Data from the event-driven trial could support global authorization and approval, including in the U.S. The Company’s ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 is expected to be fully enrolled by the end of November. Depending on the overall COVID-19 attack rate, interim data in the UK trial, which is also event-driven, are expected as soon as early first quarter 2021.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVX-CoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigen and cannot replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated induction of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. NVX-CoV2373 is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in the UK and two ongoing Phase 2 studies that began in August; a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, and a Phase 1/2 continuation in the U.S. and Australia. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $399 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and almost $1.7 billion from the U.S. government.

About Fast Track Designation

Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, with the intent of getting important new drugs to the patient earlier. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions.

51965,"Henlius Reports First Patients Dosing in P-I Study of HLX14 (denosumab, biosimilar)",First Patient Dosed in Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Henlius Denosumab Biosimilar HLX14,"The first patient has been dosed in a P-I study of HLX14, conducted in 2 parts, Part 1 is a pilot study assessing PK/PD, safety, tolerability & immunogenicity of HLX14 vs EU-sourced denosumab (SC) in healthy male volunteers
 Part 2 is a four-arm study assessing the bioequivalence of HLX14 vs US-, EU-, CN-sourced denosumab. The study also evaluates PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity between HLX14 and the reference drug
 Results from the P-I study will provide reference for the dosing scheme in the clinical studies of HLX14","Shanghai, China, November 9th, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of the company’s denosumab biosimilar HLX14, a recombinant anti-RANKL fully human monoclonal antibody injection. HLX14 was independently developed by Henlius with the denosumab originator as reference drug, and the development is in accordance with the NMPA and EMA biosimilar guidelines. It can be potentially used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.
HLX14 can increase the bone density of osteoporotic patients
In China, osteoporosis has become a severe health problem for people over 50 years old, especially for middle and aged women. More than one third of women over 50 years old are suffering from osteoporosis[1]. Health problems caused by osteoporosis, like facture, can result in significant loss of quality of life. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients with osteoporosis that have received standardized treatment is relatively low. With the increasing patient number and improved diagnosis of osteoporosis in China, the huge unmet medical needs in the treatment of osteoporosis are urgently to be addressed[2]. HLX14 can specifically bind to RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) and block the interaction between RANKL and RANK, which is expressed on the surface of osteoclasts, thus inhibiting RANKL/RANK-mediated differentiation, maturation and activation of osteoclasts, thereby reducing bone resorption and the incidence of skeletal-related events[3]. Denosumab has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture and giant cell tumor of bone by NMPA. Additional indication of denosumab has been approved in the United States and the European Union, which is for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
The result of non-clinical studies and NCT04534582 can support the following clinical studies of HLX14
Following the principles of stepwise development, comparability and similarity assessment, HLX14 has been compared with the denosumab originator via a series of head-to-head non-clinical studies. As a result, HLX14 was shown to be highly similar to denosumab in pre-clinical pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies, suggesting potential benefits for osteoporosis patients at high risk of fracture. This is a Phase 1 clinical study of HLX14 in healthy male volunteers conducted in two parts. Part 1 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-controlled, single-dose, two-arm pilot study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HLX14 and EU-sourced denosumab administered via subcutaneous injection. Part 2 is a double-blind, randomised, parallel-controlled, single-dose, four-arm study primarily aimed to establish the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of HLX14 and US-, EU-, CN-sourced denosumab (hereinafter referred to as the “reference drug”). The secondary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the similarity of pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity between HLX14 and the reference drug. Results from this Phase 1 study will provide reference for dosing scheme in the following clinical studies of HLX14.
To address the unmet clinical needs around the globe, Henlius has pro-actively built a diversified and high-quality product pipeline. Up to date, in addition to 汉利康®, the first China-developed biosimilar and 汉曲优®, the first China-developed monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar approved both in China and in the EU, HLX03 (adalimumab) is also potentially to be launched within 2020. What’s more, HLX14 and other self-developed biologics have entered clinical stage, further expanding Henlius’ therapeutic area to benefit more patients. Looking forward, Henlius will continue advancing the development of innovative biologics on the basis of its established and integrated innovation platform, to provide affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

51971,NightWare Receives the US FDA's Approval for the First Medical Device to Stop NightMAres Related to PTSD,FDA Permits Marketing of New Device Designed to Reduce Sleep Disturbance Related to Nightmares in Certain Adults,"The US FDA has permitted marketing of a device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in patients aged ≥22 yrs. suffering from nightmare disorder or PTSD
 Nightware utilizes Apple Watch and an iPhone that is configured and logged into a software application and the Nightware server and monitors the wearer’s HR and movement while they sleep and if they are having a nightmare, gently arouse them out of the dream without waking up completely, using the smartwatch’s vibrations
 The platform received the US FDA’s BT designation in May’2019 and now is available by prescription only and is intended for home use","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted marketing of a new device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 years or older who suffer from nightmare disorder or have nightmares from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The device provides gentle vibration through touch based on an analysis of heart rate and motion during sleep.

“Sleep is an essential part of a person’s daily routine. However, certain adults who have a nightmare disorder or who experience nightmares from PTSD are not able to get the rest they need. Today’s authorization offers a new, low-risk treatment option that uses digital technology in an effort to provide temporary relief from sleep disturbance related to nightmares,” said Carlos Peña, Ph.D., director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

PTSD is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, and most will recover from their symptoms over time. Those who continue to experience symptoms, which can include sleep problems and nightmares, may be diagnosed with PTSD. Certain medications may help address specific PTSD symptoms, such as sleep problems and nightmares. An experienced mental health professional can help people find the treatment plan that meets their symptoms and needs.

The device, called Nightware, is a digital therapeutic that uses an Apple Watch and an Apple iPhone that are configured and logged into a software application and the Nightware server. Throughout the night, Apple Watch sensors monitor body movement and heart rate during sleep. These data are sent to the Nightware server and, using a proprietary algorithm, the device creates a unique sleep profile for the patient. When Nightware detects that a patient is experiencing a nightmare based on its analysis of heart rate and body movement, the device provides vibrations through the Apple Watch while the product is in use. Nightware is available by prescription only and is intended for home use.

This device was studied in a 30-day randomized, sham-controlled trial of 70 patients. A sham therapy is an inactive treatment or procedure that is intended to mimic as closely as possible a therapy in a clinical trial. Patients in the sham group wore the device, but no vibratory stimulation was provided. Safety was assessed using validated measurements of suicidality and sleepiness, and there were no changes in either over the course of the study in either group. Sleep was assessed with two versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, the self-rated questionnaire for assessing sleep quality, including a version of that scale that is intended for patients with PTSD. Both the sham and active groups showed improvement on the sleep scales, with the active group showing greater improvement than sham. The evidence demonstrated the probable benefits outweighed the probable risks.

Nightware is not a standalone therapy for PTSD. The device should be used in conjunction with prescribed medications for PTSD and other recommended therapies for PTSD-associated nightmares and nightmare disorder, according to relevant consensus guidelines. Nightware is intended to be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Patients who have been known to “act out” during their nightmares (sleepwalking, violence) should not use Nightware. A healthcare provider should be contacted if daytime sleepiness occurs (If you feel drowsy, do not drive or operate heavy machinery); if the watch vibration causes awakenings not associated with nightmares; or if nightmares persist, worsen, or recur. The watch included in the Nightware kit should be used every night when the user is planning to go to sleep. The watch should not be worn while reading or watching television in bed as this may trigger false alerts. Users should not wear the watch too tightly. If skin irritation occurs, users should discontinue the use of the watch and contact a healthcare provider. The watch included in the Nightware kit may disturb the sleep of the user’s bedpartner if the bedpartner is in contact with the watch when it vibrates. Patients are advised to avoid letting the watch come in contact with their bedpartner at night.

Nightware was granted Breakthrough Device designation for the treatment of nightmares in patients with PTSD. Breakthrough Device designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

The FDA reviewed the device through the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low- to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through FDA’s 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The regulation created is for digital therapy device to reduce sleep disturbance for psychiatric conditions, prescription devices that are intended to provide stimulation using a general purpose computing platform to reduce sleep disturbance in patients who experience this symptom due to psychiatric conditions such as nightmare disorder or PTSD.

The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Nightware, Inc.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

 Radiofrequency ablation uses an electric current to heat up a small area of nerve tissue to stop it from sending pain signals. Studies showed that pain relief following a single radiofrequency ablation treatment can last from 6-12mos.
 The IonicRF generator is the first Abbott-developed radiofrequency ablation device that uses heat to target specific nerves & block pain signals from reaching the brain, currently approved in the US & EU","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Nov. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the launch of the IonicRF™ Generator – a new device recently cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to deliver a non-surgical, minimally invasive treatment for the management of pain in the nervous system. The IonicRF Generator is a radiofrequency ablation device that uses heat to target specific nerves and block pain signals from reaching the brain.

The new device is the first Abbott-developed radiofrequency ablation device and is currently approved in the United States and Europe.

“Every patient is different and the source of their pain is unique, making it extremely important to have multiple options available, so treatment can be tailored to individual circumstances,” said Jason E. Pope, M.D., Evolve Restorative Center, Santa Rosa, Calif. “Abbott’s IonicRF is an advanced device platform that targets specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. One of the most promising aspects of the therapy is its effectiveness in targeting pain in several discrete areas of the body.”

Radiofrequency ablation uses an electric current to heat up a small area of nerve tissue to stop it from sending pain signals.1 Studies have shown that pain relief following a single radiofrequency ablation treatment can last from six to 12 months.2 Low back pain is among the most common medical complaints worldwide—and facet joint syndrome, often treated by radiofrequency ablation therapy, is estimated to account for 15% of these complaints.3 Radiofrequency ablation has been used to treat pain, such as low back pain and Sacroiliac joint (buttocks) pain, that failed to resolve with conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, injections or medication.

“Most people who are candidates for radiofrequency ablation have tried other therapies, such as medications and injections, with limited success. As a result, they are now seeking an alternative solution that does not require surgery or the use of opioid medication,” said Keith Boettiger, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. “We are proud to be able to provide the first Abbott-designed radiofrequency ablation device engineered to deliver safe and effective pain management.* This is another example of our focus on widening the breadth of our neuromodulation portfolio and keeping patients central to everything we do at Abbott.”

 Results: in the HPV(-) HNSCC group, ORR (50% vs 14.6%) with 2 patients achieving CR & 3 patients achieving PR; mPFS (9.8 vs 2.0 mos.); DCR (90%); median duration of response has not been reached. No responses were observed in the MSS-CRC group of patients
 The company continues to recruit in HPV(-) HNSCC cohort and has decided to expand the size of the current cohort based on the interim data reported","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today shared interim data from the expansion cohort of its ongoing Phase 1 study of the Company’s mRNA personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) mRNA-4157 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda®1 at The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s Annual Meeting (SITC 2020). The dose expansion cohort included 10 patients with HPV(-) Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and 17 patients with Micro-Satellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC). The data shared today showed that mRNA-4157 given in combination with Keytruda® is well tolerated at all dose levels and produced responses as measured by tumor shrinkage by RECIST 1.1 criteria in HPV(-) HNSCC patients. No responses were observed in the MSS-CRC group of patients.

Tolerability data to date consistently demonstrate that mRNA-4157 is well tolerated. Adverse events are typically low grade and reversible. In the dose expansion cohort, the Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the HPV(-) HNSCC group of patients as measured by RECIST 1.1 is 50% (5/10) with two patients achieving a complete response (CR) with no detectable disease, and three patients achieving partial response (PR), all of which are ongoing. Median progression free survival (mPFS) is 9.8 months, which compares favorably to the published ORR and mPFS of 14.6% and 2.0 months respectively, for Keytruda monotherapy. Including four patients with stable disease, the Disease Control Rate (DCR) is 90% (9/10). Median duration of response has not been reached. The HPV(-) HNSCC cohort continues to recruit and Moderna has decided to expand the size of the current cohort based on the interim data reported today.

Moderna also announced that Dr. Praveen Aanur has joined Moderna as Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head for Oncology Development. Dr. Aanur joins Moderna from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) where he was responsible for multiple regulatory submissions across BMS’ immuno-oncology portfolio. In his seven years at BMS, Dr. Aanur had a wide range of roles increasing responsibility across Clinical Development and Translational Research. Dr. Aanur started his career as a physician and completed his Hematology-Oncology Fellowship at Oregon Health Sciences University, and a Fellowship in Bone Marrow Transplantation at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York where he was also a clinical investigator in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. He holds an MBBS from Bangalore University, an MPH from the University of Alabama, and an MBA from Columbia University School of Business.

“We are encouraged by these interim data from our personalized cancer vaccine program, which involves designing and manufacturing a unique vaccine for each patient based on their specific tumor,” said Stephen Hoge, M.D., President of Moderna. “This study demonstrates the ability of Moderna’s mRNA personalized cancer vaccine to elicit clinical activity when given in combination with pembrolizumab. I would also like to welcome Dr. Aanur to Moderna and look forward to working closely with him to continue building our oncology therapeutic area.”

About Moderna’s Immuno-Oncology Programs

Moderna’s oncology programs are currently focused on two main areas: cancer vaccines and intratumoral immuno-oncology (I/O) therapies. Moderna is developing these potential mRNA treatments with strategic collaborators Merck and AstraZeneca. The company currently has five I/O programs in development, including two programs in Phase 2 trials.

An advantage of Moderna’s mRNA platform is that it allows for investigational medicines that combine in a single mRNA therapy several different approaches to activate the immune system to attack cancer, either with mRNA encoding for common tumor proteins found across cancer types or multiple mRNAs encoding for various immunomodulatory proteins.

Moderna’s investigational PCVs are designed to use neoantigens identified from an individual’s tumor to program the body’s immune system to elicit a more effective anti-tumor response. Upon sequencing the tumor, Moderna’s proprietary algorithms predict the neoantigens (antigens encoded by tumor-specific mutated genes) most likely to trigger the immune system to attack a particular cancer. Today, mRNA encoding up to 34 unique neoantigens can be delivered in a single vaccine. Moderna develops and manufactures these investigational PCVs at its personalized vaccines unit within its Massachusetts manufacturing facility.

About Moderna

Moderna is advancing messenger RNA (mRNA) science to create a new class of transformative medicines for patients. mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins that can have a therapeutic or preventive benefit and have the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. The company’s platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing Moderna the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates. Moderna is developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and cardiovascular diseases, independently and with strategic collaborators.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Moderna currently has strategic alliances for development programs with AstraZeneca PLC and Merck & Co., Inc., as well as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past six years. To learn more, visit www.modernatx.com.

 Following an initial 12wks. induction treatment phase, fewer patients experienced a flare at any point in the trial @40wks. Abrocitinib is a JAK inhibitor, which modulates multiple cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of AD, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and TSLP","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today positive top-line results from the Phase 3 JADE REGIMEN study. This 52-week study investigated abrocitinib, an investigational oral once-daily Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, in patients 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) following response to initial open label induction treatment with abrocitinib 200mg. Patients were randomized into one of three arms: 200mg, 100mg, or placebo. Both doses of abrocitinib met the primary endpoint, resulting in significantly fewer patients experiencing a loss of response requiring rescue treatment, or “flaring,” compared to those randomized to placebo. Both doses also met the key secondary endpoint of a larger percentage of patients maintaining an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear relative to placebo.

“Atopic dermatitis brings a lot of uncertainty and disruption to daily life, and the unpredictability of flares can make treating and managing the disease complex and frustrating,” said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “These latest results from our Phase 3 clinical trial program shed light on the potential abrocitinib, if approved, could have to prevent troublesome flares in patients.”

JADE REGIMEN Top-Line Results

The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints. After achieving clinical response in the induction period, patients who continued on the higher dose of abrocitinib, 200mg, or switched to the lower dose, 100mg, had a significantly higher probability of not experiencing a flare compared to those on placebo through week 52 (81.1%, 57.4%, and 19.1%, respectively; p<0.0001 for both doses versus placebo). In addition, patients who continued on the higher dose of abrocitinib were significantly less likely to flare than those on the lower dose (p<0.0001). Patients on either dose of abrocitinib were significantly more likely to maintain an IGA score of clear (zero) or almost clear (one) compared to placebo (p<0.0001 for both doses versus placebo).

The primary endpoint after treatment in the 12-week induction phase was the loss of response requiring rescue treatment among groups during the blinded treatment period up to 40 weeks. Loss of response requiring rescue treatment, or a “flare,” was defined as a loss of at least 50% of the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) response at week 12 and an IGA score of two or higher (on a five-point scale). The key secondary endpoint was the loss of response based on an IGA score of two or higher.

Out of 1,233 subjects enrolled, 798 (64.7%) responded during the initial 12-week induction period with abrocitinib monotherapy (200mg, once daily), a higher than expected responder rate compared to the monotherapy studies JADE MONO-1 and JADE MONO-2. Responder criteria was defined as achieving an IGA score of clear (zero) or almost clear (one), a reduction from IGA baseline of at least two points, and reaching an EASI-75 response compared to baseline.

No new safety signals were observed in the trial. Safety results showed that during the induction period 66.5% of patients experienced an adverse event and 1.6% experienced a serious adverse event. Following randomization, a higher percentage of patients receiving either the 200mg or 100mg dose of abrocitinib experienced adverse events compared to placebo (63.2%, 54%, and 45.3%, respectively). The percentage of patients who experienced serious adverse events were 4.9%, 1.5%, and 0.7%, respectively. More patients treated with abrocitinib discontinued from the study due to adverse events (6%, 1.9%, and 1.5%, respectively). One patient died from gastric adenocarcinoma 208 days following discontinuation from the induction treatment period, which was deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator.

Additional Details About the JADE REGIMEN Study

JADE REGIMEN was a 52-week, randomized, responder-enriched, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 withdrawal trial enrolling 1,233 subjects globally. The trial included a 12-week open-label run-in period to determine responder status to an initial induction treatment with abrocitinib monotherapy (200mg, once daily). Patients in the open-label run-in period did not receive any topical therapy. Subjects with a positive clinical response to abrocitinib induction treatment at the end of the 12-week open-label run-in period entered a 40-week, double-blind, maintenance treatment period in which they were randomized into one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: placebo, abrocitinib 100mg once daily, or abrocitinib 200mg once daily. Medicated topical and/or systemic standard of care therapies were not allowed during the open-label run-in and blinded treatment periods.

During the blinded treatment period, subjects meeting the protocol definition of flare entered an open-label rescue period during which they receive another 12-week course of abrocitinib 200mg once daily with topical therapy per local standard of care (SOC). In this study, flare requiring rescue treatment was defined as a loss of at least 50% of the EASI response at week 12 and an IGA score of two or higher.

Eligible subjects completing the 40 weeks of blinded treatment, or a full 12-week rescue treatment period, had the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study, B7451015. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who were otherwise ineligible for the LTE study, entered a four-week follow up period in this study.

JADE REGIMEN is the fifth trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) global development program. Pfizer announced complete results from the second trial in the program, JADE MONO-2, as well as top-line results from the JADE TEEN and JADE COMPARE studies, earlier this year. Additionally, complete results from JADE MONO-1 were published in The Lancetin July 2020. Additional data from other studies in the JADE program will be available in the coming months.

Full results from JADE REGIMEN will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific meeting and publication in a medical journal.

About Abrocitinib

Abrocitinib is an oral small molecule that selectively inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Inhibition of JAK1 is thought to modulate multiple cytokines involved in pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

In October 2020, Pfizer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Priority Review designation to the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for abrocitinib 100mg and 200mg for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in patients 12 and older, with a decision expected in April 2021. Priority Review designation is granted to medicines that the FDA considers to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious condition. Abrocitinib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD in February 2018.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for abrocitinib in the same patient population with a decision anticipated in the second half of 2021.

Abrocitinib also received a Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this year, which indicates that a product may be eligible for the early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) based on early clinical data. EAMS aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorization when there is a clear unmet medical need.

About Atopic Dermatitis

AD is a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and skin barrier defects.1,2 Lesions of AD are characterized by erythema (skin turning red or purple depending on normal skin color), itching, induration (hardening)/papulation (formulation of papules), and oozing/crusting.2,3

AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, affecting up to 10% of adults and up to 20% of children worldwide.3,4

About Pfizer’s Immunokinase Inhibitor Leadership

The JAK pathways are believed to play an important role in inflammatory processes as they are involved in signaling for over 50 cytokines and growth factors, many of which drive immune-mediated conditions.5 JAK inhibition may offer patients with these conditions a potential new advanced treatment option.6

Pfizer’s leading JAK biology and chemistry expertise, combined with our research experience, has uniquely enabled the company to take a different R&D approach to that of other companies involved in JAK research, resulting in one of the broadest immunokinase inhibitor pipelines. Instead of studying a single molecule for all its potential uses, where it may not be optimal for some, Pfizer’s candidates with unique selectivity profiles are purposefully matched to the conditions where we believe they have the greatest potential to, if approved, address unmet need. Pfizer has five unique immunokinase inhibitors in late-stage clinical trials for the potential treatment of ten immune-mediated diseases:

Abrocitinib: A JAK1 inhibitor currently under regulatory review by the FDA and EMA for the potential treatment of moderate-to-severe AD among adolescents and adults
Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600): An oral, JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor in a phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of alopecia areata (AA) and in phase 2 for vitiligo, Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC)
Brepocitinib (PF-06700841): A tyrosine kinase 2(TYK2)/JAK1 inhibitor in phase 2 clinical trials for the potential treatment of psoriasis and AD in topical formulation, and, in oral formulation for psoriatic arthritis, CD, UC, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), AA and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)
PF-06826647: A TYK2 inhibitor under investigation in phase 2 clinical trials for the potential treatment of psoriasis and HS
PF-06650833: An IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitor under investigation for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and HS in phase 2 clinical trials

Vaccine doses for Europe will be produced in BioNTech’s German manufacturing sites, as well as in Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium. If the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate receives approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), then doses will be ordered by the EU Member States who have elected to receive the vaccine as part of this agreement.

“Since the onset of the pandemic, Pfizer’s priority has been to develop a safe and effective vaccine, while simultaneously scaling up our manufacturing to deliver doses before the end of the year. This is an ambitious goal but critical to halting this global pandemic,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer. “Today’s finalized supply agreement with the European Commission represents the largest initial order of vaccine doses for Pfizer and BioNTech to date and a major step toward our shared goal of making a COVID-19 vaccine available to vulnerable populations.”

“As a company founded in the heart of Europe, we are looking forward to supplying millions of people upon regulatory approval. We would like to thank the Commission and the Member States for their support and trust in our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Our aim is to develop a safe and effective vaccine to contribute to bringing this pandemic to an end. Only through joint efforts will we be able to do so,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

Pfizer and BioNTech announced the conclusion of exploratory talks with the European Commission to supply doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate, if approved, on September 9, 2020. The proposed supply agreement is now final.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study. The DMC reviewed 94 cases. The case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates a vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at 7 days after the second dose. This means that protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination, which consists of a 2-dose schedule. As the study continues, the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. The DMC has not reported any serious safety concerns and recommends that the study continue to collect additional safety and efficacy data as planned. The data will be discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.

In addition to engagements with governments, Pfizer and BioNTech have provided an expression of interest for possible supply to the COVAX Facility, a mechanism established by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organization (WHO) that, using a range of technology platforms, aims to provide governments, including those in the emerging markets, with early access to a large portfolio of COVID-19 candidate vaccines produced by multiple manufacturers across the world.

About the BNT162 Vaccine Candidate Program

The BNT162 program is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. Two of the companies’ four investigational vaccine candidates – BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 – received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on preliminary data from Phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the U.S. and Germany as well as animal immunogenicity studies. During preclinical and clinical studies, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 emerged as strong candidates based on assessments of safety and immune response.

On July 27, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that following extensive review of preclinical and clinical data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and in consultation with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and other global regulators, the companies selected the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate to move forward into a Phase 2/3 study. BNT162b2 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies.

About the Study

The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27, 2020 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will also include, with the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose. The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms. The companies have posted an updated version of the study protocol at https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus.

Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to accumulate safety data and currently estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second (and final) dose of the vaccine candidate – the amount of safety data specified by the FDA in its guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November. Additionally, participants will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose. Along with the efficacy data generated from the clinical trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to prepare the necessary safety and manufacturing data to submit to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and quality of the vaccine product produced.

Assuming positive data and availability of the necessary safety and manufacturing data, and based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. To meet those anticipated quantities and milestones, the companies have produced sufficient supply for their Phase 2/3 clinical trial and have begun to produce and stockpile their pandemic supply.

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. Both collaborators are committed to developing these novel vaccines with preclinical and clinical data at the forefront of all their decision making.

 The targeted immunodominant were identified through the T-Scan TCR/Target discovery platform enabling the mapping of the specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2","November 10, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time
WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–TScan Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell therapies in oncology, today announced the signing of a research license and option agreement with QIAGEN to develop T cell-based laboratory tests for detecting prior exposure to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, using discoveries from TScan’s high-throughput TCR/Target discovery platform, T-Scan. Under the terms of the agreement, QIAGEN secures an option to license the rights and intellectual property for several of TScan’s discovered immunodominant T cell targets, associated sequences and relevant data for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests. In advance of exercising its option, QIAGEN will have the right to further evaluate TScan’s discoveries.

“We are excited to partner with QIAGEN in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic by combining our unique insight into how T cells recognize the novel coronavirus with QIAGEN’s deep expertise in diagnostics,” said Gavin MacBeath, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at TScan. “Current tests for prior exposure to coronavirus rely on the detection of antibodies, which tend to diminish within a couple of months of being infected with the virus. We believe that detecting anti-viral T cells based on our discoveries will provide a more reliable way to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over a much longer period following infection. If the presence of anti-viral T cells can be linked to protection from future infection, a test like this may ultimately provide valuable information on the course of the pandemic and how to return safely to normal life.”

“As a world-wide leader in the development and commercialization of diagnostic products, QIAGEN is an ideal partner to develop T cell-based tests for COVID-19,” said David Southwell, Chief Executive Officer at TScan. “This marks our second collaboration in our efforts to provide tools in the fight against COVID-19 and highlights the urgency for continued innovation for next-generation vaccines, T cell therapeutics and T cell-based diagnostics to address the dire need posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This collaboration also reinforces the depth of our T-Scan discovery platform, including its broad application in target discovery across oncology, autoimmune disease and infectious disease that can be leveraged in-house or advanced with key partners.”

The immunodominant targets included in the agreement were identified through the T-Scan TCR/Target discovery platform, which enabled rapid and comprehensive mapping of the specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the CD8+ T cells of patients recovering from COVID-19. Importantly, the study also revealed that patients’ T cells do not cross-react with seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold, decreasing the likelihood that a T cell-based diagnostic test would result in false-positive results. TScan recently published these findings in the scientific journal Immunity in an article titled “Unbiased Screens Show CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 Patients Recognize Shared Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that Largely Reside outside the Spike Protein.” The study was conducted in collaboration with academic partners Atlantic Health System in Morristown, NJ and Ochsner Medical Center, who supported sample collection from convalescent COVID-19 patients.

Financial terms of the collaboration were not disclosed.

52052,AstraZenca's Calquence (acalabrutinib) Fails to Meet its Primary Endpoint in P-II Studies for COVID-19,Update on CALAVI Phase II trials for Calquence in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19,"The P-ll CALAVI programme involves assessing Calquence + BSC vs BSC as monothx. in patients in a ratio (1:1) hospitalized with respiratory complications of COVID-19 in the ratio of 1:1. The trials conducted in the US and in multiple other countries across the world
 The CALAVI program did not meet its 1EPs of increasing the proportion of patients who remained alive and free of respiratory failure, safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with previous studies
 Calquence is selective inhibitor of BTK, binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity","The CALAVI Phase II trials for Calquence (acalabrutinib) in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. The addition of Calquence to best supportive care (BSC) did not increase the proportion of patients who remained alive and free of respiratory failure. No new safety signal for Calquence was observed in the trials.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Since the beginning of the year, AstraZeneca has been committed to doing everything we can to respond to COVID-19, including investigating existing medicines as potential treatments. The CALAVI trials were launched based on preclinical and early clinical evidence that Calquence could decrease the hyperinflammatory immune response and improve clinical outcomes in patients hospitalised with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.1 While the CALAVI results are disappointing, we remain committed to advancing science that helps patients during this unprecedented global pandemic, including clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine and our long-acting antibody combination.”

The CALAVI programme comprised two Phase II trials investigating acalabrutinib plus BSC versus BSC alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 disease.

The safety and tolerability profiles for Calquence in the CALAVI Phase II trials were consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented in due course.

Results from the CALAVI Phase II trials do not impact approved indications or pending approvals for Calquence in patients with blood cancers.

CALAVI

The CALAVI Phase II programme comprised two randomised, open-label, multicentre trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Calquence with BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with respiratory complications of COVID-19. The trials were randomised (1:1) and evaluated the addition of Calquence to current BSC in patients who were hospitalised but not on mechanical ventilation and not in the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint measured respiratory failure or death. The trials were conducted in the US (CALAVI US) and in multiple other countries across the world (CALAVI).2,3

Calquence

Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.4,5 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.4

As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquence in more than 20 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and other haematologic malignancies.

Rather than switching between apps, users have the ability to see all their information in real-time, in one view — making it easier to make smarter dosing decisions to manage their sugar levels.

The integration of real-time CGM data into the smart insulin pen app is a result of the addition of Companion Medical’s InPen to the Medtronic portfolio, as of September 2020. The acquisition enables Medtronic to serve more people — regardless of how they prefer their insulin to be delivered — and offers a unique and expansive ecosystem of support across their diabetes journey.

“We’re strongly committed to delivering solutions that make life easier for people living with diabetes. We’re pleased to build on the success of InPen with added real-time glucose data which provides a complete picture for users as they look to give themselves the right dose of insulin at the right time,” said Sean Salmon, executive vice president and president of the Diabetes Business at Medtronic. “Our successful integration of these devices in just two months following the close of our Companion Medical acquisition is a testament to the close collaboration of our employees and strong passion to serve our customers with better solutions to manage their diabetes.”

The InPen app will continue to display information from other currently compatible CGM systems on a three-hour delay.
