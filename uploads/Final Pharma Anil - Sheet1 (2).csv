47223,Bayer Reports the NDA Submission to NMPA for Vericiguat to Treat Chronic Heart Failure in China,Bayer submits vericiguat for marketing authorization in China for the treatment of chronic heart failure,"The NDA submission was submitted to NMPA’s CDE and is based on P-III VICTORIA study, seeking regulatory approval of vericiguat in China
 In Oct’2014, Bayer and MSD signed a WW agreement for sGC modulators. The therapy is being jointly developed by both the companies as per the collaboration and has received the US FDA’s PR in Jul’2020
 Vericiguat (BAY 1021189/ MK-1242) is an sGC-stimulator being developed to treat patients with symptomatic CHF with an ejection fraction less than 45% who have had a previous worsening HF event in combination with available HF therapies","Berlin, August 28, 2020 – Bayer today announced the submission of the regulatory application seeking the approval of vericiguat in China. Vericiguat is an investigational oral, once-daily, first-in-class soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-stimulator being developed to treat patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction less than 45% who have had a previous worsening heart failure event (defined as heart failure hospitalization or receiving an intravenous diuretic for heart failure without hospitalization) in combination with available heart failure therapies. Vericiguat is being jointly developed with MSD (a tradename of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA).
“Sadly, about 50% of heart failure patients are rehospitalized within 30 days, with each hospitalization doubling the risk of death. Early identification and modification of treatment could reduce these risks,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. “With approximately 13.7 million patients living with heart failure in China, there is an urgent need for new treatment options to help reduce the burden of this disease.”

The New Drug Application was submitted to the Center of Drug Evaluation (CDE) of China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and was based on positive Phase III data from the VICTORIA study. Vericiguat has also been submitted for marketing authorization in the EU and Japan as well as multiple other countries worldwide. In addition, the U.S. FDA has granted priority review to MSD`s New Drug Application (NDA) for vericiguat in July 2020.

About Vericiguat
Vericiguat (BAY 1021189 / MK-1242) is an investigational, oral, once-daily, direct stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) enzyme. Vericiguat actively restores the functioning of a critical pathway (NO-sGC-cGMP) not addressed by current therapies. While sGC is important for the function of both the blood vessels and the heart, it is insufficiently stimulated in heart failure patients resulting in myocardial and vascular dysfunction. Vericiguat is the first-in-class sGC-stimulator under development in this indication.

About Worldwide Collaboration between Bayer and MSD
Since October 2014, Bayer and MSD (a tradename of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) are in a worldwide collaboration in the field of sGC modulators. The collaboration brings together two leading companies that have stated their intent to fully evaluate this therapeutic class in areas of unmet medical need. The vericiguat program is being co-developed by Bayer and MSD.

47282,Novartis Reports Results of LNP023 in P-II Study for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria,Novartis announces positive results from Phase II study of LNP023 in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),"The P-II study involves assessing of LNP023 in PNH patients with active hemolysis despite treatment with eculizumab
 Results: improvements in hematological response and biomarkers of disease activity; 70% discontinued eculizumab and remained on LNP023 as monothx., retaining Hb levels with no changes in biomarkers of disease activity and with no signs or symptoms of breakthrough hemolysis
 LNP023 is a potent and highly selective factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, currently in development for multiple renal conditions with complement system involvement. Additionally, the company is conducting an ongoing P-II study to assess LNP023 as monothx. for anti-C5 naïve PNH patients, with plans to initiate P-III study in late 2020","Oral, investigational complement factor B inhibitor LNP023 substantially improved hematological response as add-on therapy to eculizumab

Seven of ten patients discontinued eculizumab and remained on LNP023 as monotherapy, retaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels with no changes in biomarkers of disease activity and with no signs or symptoms of breakthrough hemolysis
Phase II results are promising for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare and life-threatening blood disorder;1,2 second Phase II study with LNP023 monotherapy in anti-C5 naïve PNH patients ongoing 
First-in-class LNP023 – which potently and selectively targets factor B, part of the immune system’s alternative complement pathway3,4,5 – is also in development for several renal conditions with complement system involvement
FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designations to LNP023 for PNH and the rare renal disease complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G)
Basel, August 29, 2020 — Novartis today announced new Phase II data for LNP023, an investigational oral treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), presented at the virtually held 2020 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Annual Meeting.

In the open-label Phase II study (NCT03439839), LNP023 demonstrated improvements in hematological response and biomarkers of disease activity in patients with active hemolysis despite treatment with eculizumab. Patients taking LNP023 as an add-on to eculizumab saw significant reductions in their lactate dehydrogenase levels, a biomarker of intravascular hemolysis, and marked improvement in their hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Compared with baseline values on eculizumab alone, LNP023 increased Hb by a clinically relevant 2.87 g/dL (p<0.001), and all but two patients (80%) achieved Hb levels >12 g/dL in the absence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. All patients required RBC transfusions prior to starting LNP023 treatment.

“In the study, LNP023 given orally resulted in transfusion avoidance and meaningful clinical benefit in PNH patients who remained anemic and dependent on transfusions despite standard of care anti-complement treatment,” said Prof. Antonio Risitano, Federico II University, Naples, and Head of Hematology and the BMT Unit, Ospedale Moscati, Avellino, Italy, who with Prof. Régis Peffault de Latour, Head of the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia and PNH, Saint-Louis Hospital, and University of Paris, are principal investigators of the study.

“These new data clearly highlight that LNP023 can control the mechanisms of hemolysis in this disease, and may potentially change the treatment paradigm for PNH,” said Prof. Peffault de Latour.

PNH is a rare and life threatening blood disorder characterized by complement-driven hemolysis, thrombosis and impaired bone marrow function,6 resulting in debilitating symptoms that can impact patient’s quality of life.7,8,9

To date, after at least six months of stable LNP023 add-on therapy, and at the investigators’ discretion, seven patients (70%) have discontinued eculizumab and remained on LNP023 as monotherapy. Importantly, all patients on LNP023 monotherapy retained their Hb levels with no changes in biomarkers of disease activity and no signs or symptoms of breakthrough hemolysis.

LNP023 also demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no serious treatment-related infections or thromboembolic events. Following the cut-off date for the presented data, one participant, who had severe lymphopenia at study entry, discontinued treatment due to a serious adverse event (AE) of lymphoproliferative disorder. The most common AEs reported were headache, insomnia, rhinitis, and rhinorrhea.

“These positive Phase II results are promising and pave the way for further evaluation of oral LNP023 as a potential monotherapy treatment and standard of care for PNH,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We will continue to develop LNP023 in this condition while exploring its use in a range of other diseases with complement system involvement.”

About LNP023
LNP023 is a first-in-class, orally administered, potent and highly selective factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway.3,4 LNP023 is currently in clinical development for PNH and a number of renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy, complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

In PNH, LNP023 acts upstream of the C5 terminal pathway, preventing not only intravascular hemolysis but also extravascular hemolysis. In doing so, LNP023 may have a therapeutic advantage over current standard of care by targeting the underlying pathophysiology.3,4 Novartis is conducting a second ongoing Phase II study (NCT03896152) to evaluate LNP023 as monotherapy for anti-C5 naïve PNH patients, with plans to start a Phase III study later this year.10

The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designations to LNP023 for the treatment of PNH and C3G.

About the Study
NCT03439839 is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, sequential 2-cohort trial to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of LNP023 in PNH patients (cohort 1: n=10) with active hemolysis despite treatment with eculizumab. The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of LNP023 on the reduction of hemolysis when administered in addition to standard of care (eculizumab) at Week 13.

After 13 weeks of treatment with LNP023, patients could be entered into a long-term study extension, which also included the possibility of modifying or discontinuing eculizumab treatment, at the investigators’ discretion.

CureApp SC
CureApp SC is a prescription medical device designed to aid patients who are receiving outpatient smoking cessation treatment. The device supports patients in their attempt to quit smoking in a home setting.
The product consists of three components – a patient app, a doctor app, and a portable CO Checker. The patient app leverages the fact that a smartphone is always by the patient’s side, enabling personalized guidance based on a patient’s therapy status and condition. The patient app is used in tandem with the portable CO Checker, allowing patients to accurately measure the concentration of carbon monoxide in their breath at home. Before the app, the home and work settings were seen as “blank” periods in a treatment program, where a medical professional could not provide an intervention. Assisting patients in such settings improves the success rate of smoking cessation. Details on the patient’s condition obtained from the patient app and the CO Checker will be shared with doctors via the doctor app. The doctor app provides doctors with greater insight into the patient’s response to treatments between checkups, allowing them to provide higher quality smoking cessation treatments and achieve greater efficiency.

“Therapeutics apps” prescribed by doctors for medical conditions represent a new form of treatment that is attracting keen interest both in Japan and abroad. In Europe and the U.S., there exist therapeutic apps that have already obtained regulatory approval and have been prescribed to patients under national and private insurance systems. The safety and efficacy of CureApp SC has been demonstrated through clinical trials and, following preliminary approval from the Medical Devices and In-Vitro Diagnostics Working Group, Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council of MHLW on June 19, CureApp SC received official regulatory approval by MHLW on August 21st. This is the world’s first therapeutics app to receive national regulatory approval for effectively treating nicotine addiction.

About Nicotine Addiction
Nicotine addiction involves both “physical addiction” and “mental addiction.” While smoking-cessation drugs are effective at treating the physical addiction and associated withdrawal symptoms, doctors struggled to tackle mental addiction with conventional approaches. The difficulty is due to physical and time restrictions that healthcare professionals have in providing therapeutic intervention outside the doctor’s office. The restrictions lead many patients to struggle against the addiction by themselves. In Japan, the success rate of conventional smoking cessation outpatient treatment at the one year mark remain under 30% (*1); there is great need for a more effective method of treatment.
The soaring rise in medical expenses in Japan has also come under the spotlight as a pressing social issue. Economic losses from excessive medical spending and labor losses caused by smoking are estimated at around 4.3 trillion yen (*2). This therapeutic app is expected to effectively reduce the smoking population, thereby reining in future medical spending.

Message from Kohta Satake, CEO of CureApp, Inc. and Practicing Doctor
We were able to successfully develop Japan’s first therapeutic app within six years of our founding. Therapeutic apps are already being prescribed in some countries, and many companies from across the globe are aggressively pursuing new research and development. However, cases such as ours where regulatory approval has been granted following a strict series of clinical trials remain few and far between. I have seen countless patients over the years as a pulmonologist, and I have unwavering confidence that this nicotine addiction therapeutic app receiving the regulatory approval will bring Japanese smokers a new approach to smoking cessation. Looking ahead, we will focus our efforts on promoting “app-based therapeutics” as a new method of treatment while continuing to push forward research and development into treatments for various other ailments besides nicotine addiction.

 Results: 39% reduction in worsening of renal function or risk of CV or renal death, ARR (5.3%) @2.4yrs., met its 2EPs with 31% reduction in death, safety and tolerability were consistent, AEs (29.5% vs 33.9%)
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monothx. and combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control, weight loss and BP reduction","Detailed results from the ground-breaking Phase III DAPA-CKD trial showed that AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin) on top of standard of care reduced the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of cardiovascular (CV) or renal death by 39% compared to placebo (p<0.0001) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion. The results were consistent in patients both with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D). CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function affecting nearly 700 million people worldwide,1,2 many of them still undiagnosed,3,4 and the most common causes are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis.5

The primary composite endpoint was ≥50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and CV or renal death. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) was 5.3% over the median time in study of 2.4 years. The trial also met all secondary endpoints, including significantly reducing death from any cause by 31% (ARR = 2.1%, p=0.0035) compared to placebo.

The co-chairs of the DAPA-CKD trial and its Executive Committee Prof. David Wheeler, University College London, UK and Prof. Hiddo L. Heerspink, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, said: “The impressive DAPA-CKD trial results are a remarkable development for patients with chronic kidney disease. These data have the potential to transform the standard of care for this patient population, which has a significant unmet need for new and improved treatment options.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “With today’s results, Farxiga becomes the first SGLT2 inhibitor proven to significantly prolong the survival of patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type-2 diabetes and we look forward to sharing these data with regulatory authorities around the world. Farxiga is also the first medicine in its class to demonstrate benefit in treating both heart failure and chronic kidney disease in patients with and without type-2 diabetes, and reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and nephropathy in type-2 diabetes.”

The safety and tolerability of Farxiga were consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine. In the trial, patients treated with Farxiga experienced fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (29.5% versus 33.9%, respectively). Diabetic ketoacidosis was not reported in the Farxiga group versus in two patients in the placebo group.

Detailed results from the DAPA-CKD trial were presented on Sunday 30 August at the ESC Congress 2020 – The Digital Experience.

In May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in adults with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D. Farxiga is currently being assessed in patients with heart failure (HF) in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials, as well as in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial.

Chronic kidney disease

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced eGFR or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months) affecting nearly 700 million people worldwide, many of them still undiagnosed.1-4 The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis.5 In its most severe form, known as  ESKD, kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.6 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.7

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga is given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause). The secondary endpoints included the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause. The trial was conducted in 21 countries and high-level results were announced in July 2020.

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hHF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

47369,Mylan and Biocon Launch Semglee (insulin glargine injection) as Vials and Pre-Filled Pen in the US,Mylan and Biocon Biologics Announce Launch of Semglee (insulin glargine injection) in the U.S. to Expand Access for Patients Living with Diabetes,"The companies have launched Semglee (insulin glargine injection) in a vial and pre-filled pen at WAC of $147.98/ package of (5) 3ml pens and $98.65/ 10ml vial, representing the lowest WAC for any long-acting insulin glargine
 The US FDA has approved Semglee for the same indications as to its reference product Sanofi’s Lantus, thus expanding access for millions of patients living with diabetes
 Additionally, Mylan has submitted all necessary documentation to the FDA, requesting the approval of Semglee as a biosimilar to Lantus under the 351(k) pathway. Semglee has received regulatory approval in 45+ countries and is the third FDA’s approved product under the Mylan-Biocon collaboration","HERTFORDSHIRE, England and PITTSBURGH and BENGALURU, India, Aug. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) and Biocon Biologics India Ltd., a subsidiary of Biocon Ltd. (BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON), today announced the U.S. launch of Semglee™ (insulin glargine injection) in vial and pre-filled pen presentations, approved to help control high blood sugar in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes. It is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Semglee, which received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has an identical amino acid sequence to Sanofi’s Lantus® and is approved for the same indications.

(PRNewsfoto/Mylan N.V.)
Dr. Thomas Blevins, M.D., lead investigator for the INSTRIDE clinical trials, said: “The availability of Semglee provides another quality treatment option for patients living with diabetes in the U.S. We rigorously compared Semglee (insulin glargine injection) to the reference insulin glargine in participants with Type 1 and 2 diabetes and found that Semglee yielded similar (non-inferior) glycemic results in both groups. The safety, including immunogenicity, was similar too. As a result, this insulin was approved by the FDA for the same indications as its reference product Lantus, thus expanding access for millions of people within this important patient community.”

To encourage broad patient access to this important medicine, Mylan is offering Semglee at a wholesale acquisition cost (WAC)1 of $147.98 per package of five (5) 3ml pens and $98.65 per 10ml vial, representing the lowest WAC for any long-acting insulin glargine on the market. The list price of Semglee pen is equivalent to the Lantus launch price in 2007, and the Semglee vial is listed at Lantus’s 2010 pricing. Eligible patients may also qualify for patient assistance and/or a co-pay card, similar to other medications in this class. Additionally, Mylan has submitted to FDA all necessary documentation to request approval of Semglee as a biosimilar to Lantus under the 351(k) pathway and remains confident in seeking an interchangeability designation.

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said: “We are proud to be the first company, following the reference product, to receive FDA approval on and launch both the vial and pen presentations of an insulin glargine treatment with an identical amino acid sequence to Sanofi’s Lantus®. Even more importantly, we are proud to make Semglee available to the more than 30 million Americans living with diabetes in the U.S.2, providing more treatment options and increasing access. While providing our product at the most competitive list price on the market is an important step toward ensuring that those who need insulin are able to access and afford it, we also know that there is still work to be done to ensure this access and affordability reaches patients at the pharmacy counter. We remain committed to work across the healthcare system to improve outcomes for all.”

Mylan President Rajiv Malik said: “Bringing to market both the vial and pen presentations of Semglee, the first for any company following the reference product, required years of investment and commitment, and represents another important example of the power of the unique platform we’ve built along with our partner Biocon Biologics in terms of our research and development, regulatory, legal and commercial expertise. Today’s launch also furthers our continued efforts to serve patients through the availability of a full portfolio of short- and long-acting insulins, which also includes our insulin aspart that we expect to launch next year. Our near-term strategy to ensure the availability of Semglee will require a strategic and targeted phased launch approach. Over the long term, we expect this addition to our portfolio to play an increasingly important role within our global biosimilars and insulin analog franchise as well as our efforts to advance access to complex medicines.”

Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon said: “The commercialization of our insulin glargine in the U.S. represents another milestone achievement for Biocon in making insulin-based therapy increasingly accessible for people with diabetes globally. We are confident that along with our long-standing partner Mylan, we will be able to address the needs of millions of patients living with diabetes in the U.S.  Leveraging our science and global scale manufacturing expertise, we have been expanding affordable access to biosimilar insulins to patients in Japan, Australia, Europe, India and key emerging markets. The U.S. launch of Semglee takes us closer to realizing our aspiration of reaching ‘one in five’ insulin dependent people with diabetes worldwide.”

Dr. Christiane Hamacher, CEO, Biocon Biologics said: “It is indeed a proud moment for Biocon Biologics to make Semglee (insulin glargine injection) available to patients in the U.S. Our unwavering focus on developing and manufacturing global quality insulins enables us to address the growing needs of diabetes patients and the healthcare systems. We stay committed to expand affordable access to life-saving global quality biosimilars and insulin analogs and generating savings for the U.S. healthcare system. We believe the U.S. market represents a great opportunity for us and expect Semglee to contribute significantly to our goal of impacting 5 million patients’ lives and achieving $1 billion revenue by end of FY22.”

The approval for Semglee was based on a comprehensive analytical, preclinical and clinical program (including the INSTRIDE studies) which confirmed the PK/PD, efficacy, safety profile and immunogenicity of Semglee as compared to Lantus in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Today’s launch follows favorable judgments on all remaining patent claims asserted by Sanofi against Mylan’s insulin glargine products. Although Sanofi may seek certain appeals of those judgments, Mylan is confident they will not affect commercialization.

Sanofi’s total IQVIA sales for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020 were approximately $1.64 billion for Lantus 100 Units/mL Vial and approximately $4.36 billion for Lantus SoloSTAR Pen.

Mylan and Biocon Biologic’s insulin glargine has received regulatory approval in more than 45 countries around the world and is the third product approved by FDA through the Mylan-Biocon Biologics collaboration.

About the INSTRIDE Studies
The INSTRIDE 1 and INSTRIDE 2 studies were randomized, confirmatory clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mylan’s proposed insulin glargine, MYL-1501D, versus branded insulin glargine, Lantus. INSTRIDE 1 was a 52-week noninferiority study in 558 T1DM patients, while INSTRIDE 2 was a 24-week study in 560 T2DM (including insulin-naïve) patients. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive either once daily MYL-1501D or Lantus and the primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included glycemic endpoints like change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose and insulin dose, as well as safety endpoints like systemic reactions, device-related safety issues and immunogenicity. The safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data from these studies in T1DM and T2DM patients indicated that there were no differences in the Semglee and Lantus arms.

Important Safety Information
Semglee is a long-acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not use during episodes of hypoglycemia or if hypersensitive to insulin glargine or it’s excipients. Patients should be instructed to never share the prefilled pen even if the needle is changed. Changes to a patient’s insulin regimen should be done under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring as hyper- or hypoglycemia may occur. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin, including Semglee and it may be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, coadministered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Medication errors can result from accidental mix-ups among insulin products. Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before injection. Severe, life-threatening generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis can occur with insulin products, including Semglee. If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Semglee and treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve.  Monitor potassium levels for hypokalemia and treat if indicated. Fluid retention and heart failure have been reported with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZD). Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs.

AZD1222 supported by safety and immunogenicity across all adult age groups

August 31, 2020 04:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time
WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AZD1222 development expanded into a Phase III clinical trial in the US to assess its safety, efficacy and immunogenicity.1

The US trial, called D8110C00001, is funded by the Biomedical Advanced Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and led by AstraZeneca. The NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) will participate in the trial.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “We are pleased that AZD1222 demonstrated safety and immunogenicity across all adult age groups and are proud to be collaborating with BARDA and NIAID to accelerate the development of this vaccine. Should clinical trials demonstrate the vaccine protects against COVID-19 disease and is approved for use, we will work hard to make it globally available in a fair and equitable manner as rapidly as possible.”

Trial centers across the US are recruiting up to 30,000 adults aged 18 years or over from diverse racial, ethnic and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions, including those living with HIV, and who are at increased risk of infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Centers outside the US are included based on predicted transmission rates of the virus and sites in Peru and Chile are planned to initiate recruitment shortly.

Participants are being randomized to receive two doses of either AZD1222 or a saline control, four weeks apart, with twice as many participants receiving the potential vaccine than the saline control. The trial is assessing efficacy and safety of the vaccine in all participants, and local and systemic reactions and immune responses will be assessed in 3,000 participants.

Clinical development of AZD1222 is progressing globally with late-stage clinical trials ongoing in the UK, Brazil and South Africa and trials are planned to start in Japan and Russia. These trials, together with the US Phase III clinical trial will enroll up to 50,000 participants globally. Results from the late-stage trials are anticipated later this year, depending on the rate of infection within the clinical trial communities.

In July 2020, interim results from the ongoing Phase I/II COV001 trial were published in The Lancet and showed AZD1222 was tolerated and generated robust immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in all evaluated participants.

AstraZeneca continues to engage with governments, multilateral organizations and partners around the world to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine, should clinical trials prove successful. Recent supply announcements with Russia, South Korea, Japan, China, Latin America and Brazil take the global supply capacity towards three billion doses of the vaccine.

The Company today issued a commitment to the highest safety standards and to broad and equitable access, reiterating its core values to “follow the science” and “put patients first”.

D8110C000011
D8110C00001 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19, in up to 30,000 participants across approximately 100 trial centers in and outside the US. Trial participants aged 18 years or over who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases, and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular doses of either 5 x1010 viral particles of AZD1222 or saline placebo four weeks apart, on day one and 29. Randomization will be stratified by age (≥ 18 to < 65 years, and ≥ 65 years), with at least 25% of participants to be enrolled in the older age range. Individuals interested in participating in the Phase III D8110C00001 vaccine trial can visit https://www.c19vaccinestudy.com or www.CoVPN.org websites for more information.

AZD1222
AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

In May 2020, AstraZeneca received support of more than $1bn from BARDA for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine. The Phase III D8110C00001 trial is part of this funding agreement.

Issued: San Francisco and London

Phase 2/3 COMET-ICE study will investigate the safety and efficacy of antibody treatment in preventing hospitalisation due to COVID-19
Potential for initial study results to be available before the end of 2020, with early access to the antibody treatment as soon as the first half of 2021
Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced that the first patient was dosed last week in a phase 2/3 study with VIR-7831 (also known as GSK4182136), a fully human anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2) monoclonal antibody, for the early treatment of COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of hospitalisation.

The aim of the COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial – Intent to Care Early) study, which will enrol approximately 1,300 patients worldwide who have early symptomatic infection, is to assess whether VIR-7831, as a single-dose monoclonal antibody, can prevent hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Initial results may be available before the end of this year, with complete results expected in the first quarter of 2021, and potentially early access to the antibody treatment as soon as the first half of 2021. Last week’s initiation of the study follows the signing of a collaboration between the two companies in April 2020 to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses.

George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Vir, said: “Treating those with early COVID-19 disease so that it doesn’t become worse is critical both for the patients and for society. Hospital systems are overwhelmed worldwide, with new infections continuing to strain already limited resources. This study is designed to demonstrate whether VIR-7831 can significantly reduce the need for hospitalisation in high-risk individuals, such as the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions such as lung or heart disease.”

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus could provide an effective and immediate immune response to COVID-19, bypassing the need for our body to produce its own antibodies, which is particularly important in the absence of an effective vaccine. This study will assess the ability of VIR-7831 to prevent high-risk individuals from progressing to severe disease, and in future studies we will also test the antibody’s ability to prevent infection in high-risk patients and to reduce disease severity in patients who are already hospitalised.”

Monoclonal antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, are being investigated as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic approach against the disease. They are produced, or cloned, from immune cells in a laboratory. Vir’s antibody platform has identified unique antibodies from survivors that may work by blocking the virus from infecting new cells (neutralisation) and by recruiting the immune system to eliminate infected cells (effector function).

A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the spike protein that covers the virus’ outer surface. The virus uses these spike proteins to bind to and enter human cells, leading to infection. It is hypothesised that monoclonal antibodies directed against the spike proteins could represent a therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Pre-clinical studies with VIR-7831, which was identified through Vir’s antibody platform, showed affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and high potency in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a high barrier to resistance and an ability to recruit immune cells to kill already infected cells. In addition, VIR-7831 has been designed to enhance lung bioavailability.

The COMET-ICE multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 study investigating
VIR-7831 in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease comprises two parts. The first part (the Lead-In phase) will serve as the first-in-human assessment. The Lead-In phase will assess the safety and tolerability of a single 500 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of VIR-7831 or placebo over a 14-day period in non-hospitalised patients. It aims to recruit 20 patients across the United States. Following this initial safety assessment, the second part (the Expansion phase) will progress with the aim of reducing the need for hospitalisation. The Expansion phase will assess the safety and efficacy of a single IV infusion of VIR-7831 or placebo in approximately 1,300 non-hospitalised participants globally. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 who worsen, as defined by the need for hospitalisation or death, within 29 days of randomisation.

The COMET clinical development programme for VIR-7831 also includes two additional planned trials—one for the treatment of severely ill hospitalised patients, and another for the prophylaxis of symptomatic infection.

Later this year, the companies expect to start a phase 2 trial of their other investigational SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, VIR-7832, which shares the same characteristics as VIR-7831 but may in addition also function as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic T cell vaccine.

About VIR-7831 / GSK4182136
VIR-7831 (GSK4182136) is a monoclonal antibody that has shown the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 live virus in vitro. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (also known as SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for escape mutants to develop. VIR-7831/GSK4182136 has been engineered to enhance lung bioavailability and have an extended half-life.

About VIR-7832
VIR-7832 is a monoclonal antibody that has shown the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 live virus in vitro. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (also known as SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for escape mutants to develop. VIR-7832 has been engineered to enhance lung bioavailability, have an extended half-life, and potentially function as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic T cell vaccine.

The agreement follows the supply agreement b/w the companies signed on May 28, 2020 for exclusively manufacture AZD1222 at 200L scale and associated process development","The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014. Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.

Oxford, UK – 1 September, 2020: Oxford Biomedica plc (LSE:OXB) (“Oxford Biomedica” or “the Group”), a leading gene and cell therapy group, announced today that it has signed an 18 month supply agreement under a three year Master Supply and Development Agreement (“the Agreement”) with AstraZeneca UK Ltd (“AstraZeneca”) for large-scale commercial manufacture of the adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222. The Parties may extend the supply period for AZD1222 by a further 18 months into 2022 and 2023 by mutual agreement.

Under the terms of the Agreement, AstraZeneca will pay Oxford Biomedica £15million upfront as a capacity reservation fee. Subject to satisfactory scale up of manufacturing capacity and continuation of the vaccine programme, Oxford Biomedica expects to receive additional revenue in excess of £35million plus certain materials costs for the manufacture of multiple large-scale batches of AZD1222 until the end of 2021.

As part of the Agreement, Oxford Biomedica will reserve capacity for AstraZeneca in up to three manufacturing suites in the Group’s new 7,800 m2 commercial manufacturing centre, Oxbox, for an initial 18 month period. This new GMP facility is suitable for manufacturing viral vectored vaccines and gene therapy vectors up to 1,000 litre scale. As part of Oxford Biomedica’s previously announced partnership with the UK’s Vaccine Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC) two new manufacturing suites within Oxbox will become operational in the next two months, significantly earlier than originally planned by the Group.

While this Agreement means the Group has dedicated multiple new manufacturing suites to this critical project, importantly, Oxford Biomedica does not expect any impact to the Groups current partnerships or ability to secure and support additional new partnerships in the cell and gene therapy field.

This agreement builds on the supply agreement between the companies announced on 28th May, which related exclusively to manufacture of AZD1222 at 200L scale and associated process development.

John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Biomedica, said: “We have been working hard with AstraZeneca and other partners to establish GMP manufacturing of AZD1222 at scale, and we are therefore very pleased to extend our current partnership to include large-scale manufacturing of the vaccine candidate, AZD1222. Our previously announced partnership with the UK’s Vaccine Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC) has supported our ability to make additional facilities available for this supply agreement. We look forward to continuing to work with AstraZeneca to rapidly contribute to the global effort to support the large-scale manufacturing of AZD1222 to ensure that the vaccine candidate is available if and when it is approved by Regulatory Authorities.”

47613,Roche's Enspryng (satralizumab) Receives Health Canada Approval for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder,Health Canada Authorizes ENSPRYNG for Canadians Living with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder,"The approval is based on two P-III studies: The SAkuraStar & SAkuraSky studies involves assessing Enspryng as monothx. and in combination with IST vs PBO in 95 & 83 NMOSD patients who are AQP4 seropositive aged 18-74yrs. & 12-74yrs. respectively
 SAkuraStar & SAkuraSky results: 74% & 79% reduction in the risk of relapses respectively
 Enspryng (SC, q4w) is a mAb targeting IL-6R treatment. Additionally, Canada is the first country to receive health authority approval for Enspryng, offering a new treatment option for NMOSD","ENSPRYNG is a targeted IL-6R treatment that is administered every four weeks by subcutaneous injection[1]

MISSISSAUGA, ON, Aug. 31, 2020 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) announced today that Health Canada has granted market authorization for ENSPRYNG® (satralizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients who are anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive. The treatment is not intended for acute treatment of an NMOSD relapse.[1] Canada is the first country to receive health authority approval for ENSPRYNG, offering a new treatment option for people living with NMOSD.

The Health Canada market authorization of ENSPRYNG was based on data from two phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, SAkuraSky and SAkuraStar.[1]

“The impact that NMOSD can have on patients is extensive where even one sudden relapse may result in blindness and paralysis,” said Dr. Anthony Traboulsee, Director, MS and NMO Clinic, Djavad Mowfaghian Centre for Brain Health, the University of British Columbia. “In clinical trials we witnessed the benefits that ENSPRYNG can provide people living with NMOSD in preventing relapses, and I believe this treatment can potentially improve the future outlook of Canadians who live with this serious neurological condition, decreasing the fear and uncertainty of when and how severe their next relapse may be.”

NMOSD is a rare autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system where antibodies can damage the spinal cord and/or optic nerves during attacks. There are approximately 1,000 to 3,000 Canadians living with NMOSD[2], with the disease being most commonly diagnosed among non-Caucasian women[3] in their 20s to 40s.[4] People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability.[4],[5] The condition can be confused with multiple sclerosis (MS), however NMOSD is less common than MS and its attacks can be more severe.[4] In fact, studies have found that 62 per cent of patients are blind within five to six years of disease onset and approximately 50 per cent of patients need assistance with walking short distances after five years.[6],[7],[8]

“We are pleased that Canadians with NMOSD, one of the allied diseases we support, have an additional option available to manage their disease. Access to new treatments is critical in disease management throughout a person’s journey with NMOSD,” said Dr. Pamela Valentine, President and CEO, MS Society of Canada.

About the Health Canada Approval
The Health Canada market authorization of ENSPRYNG was based on data from the SAkuraSky and SAkuraStar studies. The SAkuraStar study was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of ENSPRYNG monotherapy compared to placebo in 95 NMOSD patients from the age of 18 to 74. The SAkuraSky study was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that included 83 NMOSD patients, including adolescents from the age of 12 to 74, to evaluate the effect of ENSPRYNG in combination with stable immunosuppressive therapy.[1] Data from the studies demonstrated the following:

SAkuraStar: Patients treated with ENSPRYNG achieved a 74 percent reduction in the risk of relapses compared to placebo in the AQP4-IgG seropositive patient population (HR:0.45; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.89; p=0.0184).[1]
SAkuraSky: Patients achieved a 79 percent reduction in the risk of relapses in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients when used in combination with baseline therapy compared to baseline therapy plus placebo (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.88; p=0.0184).[1]
In both the SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky studies, the rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable between ENSPRYNG and placebo groups, as monotherapy or in combination with baseline therapy. The most common adverse events in both treatment groups were headache (24.4 and 15.9 per cent), arthralgia (9.8 and 15.9 per cent), and injection related reactions (12.2 and 12.7 per cent). None of the injection related reactions required dose interruption or discontinuation.[1]

About Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder
NMOSD is a demyelinating condition, meaning, it damages the protective myelin sheath around the nerve fibres.[4]  NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies that target and damage a specific cell type called astrocytes resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain.[9],[10] AQP4-IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around two-thirds of NMOSD patients.[5]

About ENSPRYNG (satralizumab)
ENSPRYNG is a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6R receptor, [5] which is thought to be a key driver in NMOSD.[9] People with active NMOSD can have higher levels of IL-6R, so blocking IL-6R signaling is believed to reduce inflammation, dampen production of AQP4-IgG, decrease blood-brain barrier permeability, and prevent astrocyte damage which therefore may limit NMOSD disease activity.[5],[6],[11]

ENSPRYNG is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). The first injection is given under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The first three injections are given once every two weeks and are known as ‘loading doses.’ After this, the injection is given every four weeks. This is called a ‘maintenance dose.’ ENSPRYNG is then taken once every four weeks as prescribed by a healthcare professional.[1]

Combines confirmatory HIV testing and HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation into one single test

Basel, 1 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the cobas® HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Test for use on the fully automated cobas® 6800/8800 Systems in the U.S. The test provides healthcare professionals with a single result to confirm HIV diagnosis and differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2, an important distinction needed to identify appropriate treatment options.

“Roche is committed to improving diagnostic technologies in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Being able to reliably determine a person’s HIV status and accurately diagnose which HIV type they may have is crucial for patients and healthcare providers in preventing further community transmission and selecting an individual’s best treatment options.”

Studies show that 50% of new HIV infections may be transmitted during the acute period, between three days and three weeks from the time of infection1. Current serology-based testing methods rely on the ability to detect an antibody or antigen response. As a result, they can fail to identify an infection if the person is tested prior to having a detectable antibody or antigen response, which can take several weeks to generate. The higher sensitivity of PCR technology, which is used with the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Test, can reduce this time-to-detection period by one week or more. This significant reduction in time to detection is critical to improve personalised healthcare while curbing further disease transmission.

About the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative Test   
cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) RNA in human serum and plasma.

The test is intended to be used as an aid in diagnosis of HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. Detection of HIV-1 or HIV-2 nucleic acid is indicative of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, respectively. The presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 nucleic acid in the plasma or serum of individuals without antibodies to HIV-1 or HIV-2 is indicative of acute or primary infection. cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qualitative may also be used as an additional test to confirm the presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in an individual with specimens reactive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies or antigens. The assay may also be used as an aid in the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 in pediatric subjects and pregnant women.

About HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the U.S.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated in 2018 that 1.2 million people were living with HIV in the United States. Among them, more than 160,000 people did not know their HIV status, and only 53 percent were virally suppressed having low amounts of virus circulating in their blood. During this same year, 37,968 people became newly infected with HIV2.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is categorized into two types, HIV-1 and HIV-2. Worldwide, most HIV infections are HIV-1, whereas HIV-2 largely has been confined to persons in or from West Africa. However, HIV-2 has been steadily increasing in the U.S. due to immigration3. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have the same routes of transmission, and both can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, it is important to differentiate HIV-2 infections from HIV-1 infections because they require different clinical management4.

47721,AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) Receives EC's Approval as 1L Treatment for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,Imfinzi approved in the EU for the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer,"The approval is based on P III CASPIAN study assessing Imfinzi + etoposide and either carboplatin/ cisplatin CT or Imfinzi + CT + tremelimumab vs PBO in 805 patients with ES-SCLC in 200 centers across 23 countries. The approval follows the CHMP’s positive opinion received in July’2020
 Results: the study met its 1EPs of OS (13.0 vs 10.3mos.); ORR (68% vs 58%); 27% reduction in risk of death with delay in time for disease symptoms to worsen. Updated analysis: m-OS (12.9 vs 10.5 mos.); safety & tolerability is consistent with a known safety profile
 Imfinzi is a mAb targeting PD-L1 and blocks PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 and CD80, currently being evaluated as monothx. and in combination with tremelimumab for multiple cancer indications and in P-III ADRIATIC trial for patients with limited-stage SCLC","Only PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant survival benefit and improved response rate in combination with a choice of chemotherapies
AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been approved in the European Union for the 1st-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in combination with a choice of chemotherapies, etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin.

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.1,2

The approval by the European Commission was based on positive results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial showing Imfinzi plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit for the 1st-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC. It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in July 2020.

Luis Paz-Ares MD, Ph.D., Chair, Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain and principal investigator in the Phase III CASPIAN trial said: “For the first time, patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in Europe will have the option of an immunotherapy combination with cisplatin, a preferred chemotherapy for many European physicians in this setting. Today’s approval of Imfinzi provides physicians with an important new 1st-line treatment option that provides significant overall survival benefit with a well-tolerated treatment.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Imfinzi plus chemotherapy is becoming a new global standard of care for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, and we are pleased to bring this option to patients in Europe who urgently need it. This is the first immunotherapy regimen to offer both a sustained survival benefit and an improved response rate, as well as a choice of chemotherapies and convenient dosing every four weeks during maintenance.”

The CASPIAN trial met the primary endpoint of OS for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy in June 2019, reducing the risk of death by 27% versus chemotherapy alone (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047), with median OS of 13.0 months versus 10.3 months for chemotherapy alone. These results were published in The Lancet in 2019.3 Results also showed an increased confirmed objective response rate for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy (68% versus 58% for chemotherapy alone) and that Imfinzi added to chemotherapy delayed the time for disease symptoms to worsen.

An updated analysis recently showed sustained efficacy for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy after a median follow up of more than two years (OS HR: 0.75; 95% CI 0.62-0.91; nominal p=0.0032), with median OS of 12.9 months versus 10.5 months for chemotherapy alone. The safety and tolerability for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of these medicines. No patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies to Imfinzi.

The CASPIAN trial used a fixed dose of Imfinzi (1500mg) administered every three weeks for four cycles while in combination with chemotherapy and then every four weeks until disease progression.

Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is also approved in the US, Japan and several other countries for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting and is currently under regulatory review in other countries.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial.

Small cell lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.4 Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.5 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with ES-SCLC, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.6 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.6

CASPIAN

CASPIAN was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or Imfinzi and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms. In June 2019, AstraZeneca announced the CASPIAN trial had met one primary endpoint of demonstrating OS for Imfinzi plus chemotherapy at a planned interim analysis. In March 2020, it was announced that the second experimental arm with tremelimumab did not meet its primary endpoint of OS.

Imfinzi

Imfinzi is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on results from Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

An extensive Immuno-Oncology (IO) development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation, which represent up to three quarters of all patients with lung cancer.7 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease, including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline, including Enhertu.

AstraZeneca’s approach to IO

IO is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology.

INDICATION

PALFORZIA is an oral immunotherapy indicated for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut. PALFORZIA is approved for use in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy. Initial Dose Escalation may be administered to patients aged 4 through 17 years. Up-Dosing and Maintenance may be continued in patients 4 years of age and older.

PALFORZIA is to be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet.

Limitations of Use: Not indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Boxed WARNING:

PALFORZIA can cause anaphylaxis, which may be life threatening and can occur at any time during PALFORZIA therapy.

Prescribe injectable epinephrine, instruct and train patients on its appropriate use, and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care upon its use.

Do not administer PALFORZIA to patients with uncontrolled asthma.

Dose modifications may be necessary following an anaphylactic reaction.

Observe patients during and after administration of the Initial Dose Escalation and the first dose of each Up-Dosing level, for at least 60 minutes.

PALFORZIA is available only through a restricted program called the PALFORZIA REMS.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

PALFORZIA is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma, or with a history of eosinophilic esophagitis and other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Anaphylaxis

PALFORZIA can cause anaphylaxis, which may be life threatening. PALFORZIA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the PALFORZIA REMS because of the risk of anaphylaxis. Only prescribers, healthcare settings, pharmacies, and patients certified and enrolled in the REMS Program can prescribe, receive, dispense or administer PALFORZIA.

Anaphylaxis has been reported during all phases of PALFORZIA dosing, including Maintenance and in subjects who have undergone recommended Up-Dosing and dose modification procedures.

Do not initiate PALFORZIA treatment in a patient who has had severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis within the previous 60 days. PALFORZIA may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may reduce the ability to survive anaphylaxis, including but not limited to markedly compromised lung function, severe mast cell disorder, or cardiovascular disease. In addition, PALFORZIA may not be suitable for patients taking medications that can inhibit or potentiate the effects of epinephrine.

All Initial Dose Escalation doses and the first dose of each Up-Dosing level must be administered in a certified health care setting.

Patients may be more likely to experience allergic reactions following PALFORZIA administration in the presence of cofactors such as exercise, hot water exposure, intercurrent illness (e.g., viral infection), or fasting. Other potential cofactors may include menstruation, sleep deprivation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, or uncontrolled asthma. Patients should be proactively counseled about the potential for the increased risk of anaphylaxis in the presence of these cofactors. If possible, adjust the time of dosing to avoid these cofactors. If it is not possible to avoid these cofactors, consider withholding PALFORZIA temporarily.

Asthma

Uncontrolled asthma is a risk factor for a serious outcome, including death, in anaphylaxis. Ensure patients with asthma have their asthma under control prior to initiation of PALFORZIA.

PALFORZIA should be temporarily withheld if the patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. Following resolution of the exacerbation, resumption of PALFORZIA should be undertaken cautiously. Re-evaluate patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations and consider discontinuation of PALFORZIA.

Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disease

Discontinue PALFORZIA and consider a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients who experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were commonly reported in PALFORZIA-treated subjects, and dose modification should be considered for patients who report these reactions. For severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms consider a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse events reported in subjects treated with PALFORZIA (incidence ≥ 5% and ≥ 5% than placebo) are abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, oral pruritus, oral paresthesia, throat irritation, cough, rhinorrhea, sneezing, throat tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, and ear pruritus.

DUBLIN, Sept. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its MiniMed™ 770G hybrid closed loop system. This newest insulin pump system offers the company’s most advanced SmartGuard™ technology, as featured in the MiniMed™ 670G system, with the added benefits of smartphone connectivity and an expanded age indication to children as young as 2.

This latest system by Medtronic expands the benefits of hybrid closed loop therapy to younger children living with type 1 diabetes and makes it easier to access and share real-time CGM and pump data. The system will enable caregivers and care partners to see user data remotely on their smartphones, with proactive in-app notices sent when sugar levels are out of range. The data can also be shared automatically with clinicians and educators to help facilitate more effective telehealth visits and product trainings. This connectivity also gives Medtronic the ability to provide upgrades to future technology via software updates which can further enhance security and device features.

“We’re thrilled to be launching this new system as we understand how important these data sharing features are, particularly right now — with many individuals and families opting to see their doctors virtually via telehealth visits,” said Sean Salmon, executive vice president and president of the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. “As a parent, I understand very personally why connectivity is so important and I’m pleased we’ll be able to broaden access to hybrid closed loop therapy with the additional peace of mind caregivers need to ensure the well-being of their loved ones. This latest launch underscores my personal commitment to making life easier for people living with diabetes through the technologies we deliver.”

The growing body of clinical evidence on hybrid closed loop therapy demonstrates both the safety of the technology and improved clinical outcomes across adults, adolescents and younger children. A clinical study of the MiniMed 670G system conducted in children two to six years of age showed an improvement in outcomes comparable to those observed in older adolescents and adults, and supported the submission of the MiniMed 770G system. In the study, A1C and Time in Range from 151 children were assessed alongside outcomes from 124 adolescents and adults over two weeks in Manual Mode and three months in SmartGuard Auto Mode (hybrid closed loop algorithm)1. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, and no serious device-related adverse events while in SmartGuard Auto Mode.

“When young children are diagnosed with diabetes it is a family disease with parents and caregivers playing a substantial role in diabetes management,” said Jennifer McVean, M.D., pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health . “Being able to offer my patients an insulin pump system that provides safe, automated insulin delivery  and smartphone connectivity is incredibly beneficial. I have seen favorable results with the MiniMed 670G system in my practice, and the younger age indication that the MiniMed 770G system offers can change the lives of even more people living with type 1 diabetes.”

The algorithm that powers the insulin pump, known as SmartGuard Auto Mode, refers to the system’s ability to continually adjust the amount of insulin delivered every five minutes, 24 hours a day, based on the needs of the individual. The goal of this automated delivery of background insulin is to maximize the time glucose levels are within the optimal target range and to minimize both high and low glucose levels. The new MiniMed 770G system comes with the Guardian™ Sensor 34, the MiniMed™ Mobile app (compatible with both iPhone and Android), and Roche Accu-Chek® Guide Link meter, which is Bluetooth® compatible for improved usability.

Medtronic will begin taking orders for the new MiniMed 770G system in the United States this week.

September 01, 2020 12:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time
PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Onureg® (azacitidine 300 mg tablets, CC-486) for the continued treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieved first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following intensive induction chemotherapy and who are not able to complete intensive curative therapy.1 AML is one of the most common acute leukemias in adults.

The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 QUAZAR® AML-001 study in which treatment with Onureg resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), the study’s primary endpoint, of nearly 10 months compared to placebo. Median OS from time of randomization was greater than two years (24.7 months; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 18.7 to 30.5) among patients who received Onureg compared to 14.8 months (95% CI: 11.7 to 17.6) among patients receiving placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86; p=0.0009). Onureg was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Onureg has warnings and precautions for risks of substitution with other azacitidine products, myelosuppression, increased early mortality in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and embryo-fetal toxicity. Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, Onureg should not be substituted for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine as it may result in a fatal adverse reaction. New or worsening Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 49% and 22% of patients who received Onureg, respectively. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12% of patients. Complete blood counts should be monitored, dosing should be modified as recommended and standard supportive care should be provided if myelosuppression occurs. Enrollment was discontinued early in the study AZA-MDS-003 due to a higher incidence of early fatal and/or serious adverse reactions in the Onureg arm compared with the placebo arm. Treatment of MDS with Onureg is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Onureg can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

“Continued treatment with Onureg demonstrated an overall survival benefit in adults with AML who had achieved first complete remission in the QUAZAR® AML-001 study and, notably, it has the potential to do this in a convenient manner, given its once daily oral formulation,”1 said Andrew Wei, MBBS, Ph.D., QUAZAR® AML-001 lead investigator, Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. “This approval should help establish continued treatment with Onureg as a standard component of AML therapy for adults who achieved first complete remission following chemotherapy and who cannot proceed to intensive curative therapy, like hematopoietic stem cell transplant.”

“The FDA approval of Onureg is the culmination of over a decade of research and 13 pre-clinical and clinical trials. We are grateful to the patients, families and caregivers who participated in and supported these trials, and who ultimately made today’s advancement possible,” said Giovanni Caforio, M.D., chairman and chief executive officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “This milestone is representative of our commitment to helping patients with hard-to-treat cancers live longer, and the approval of Onureg as an oral therapy option for patients is more relevant now than ever as the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The New Drug Application was granted Priority Review Designation by the FDA, and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for this indication was validated by the European Medicines Agency in May 2020.

QUAZAR® AML-001 Pivotal Trial Results

The FDA approval of Onureg is based on data from QUAZAR® AML-001, a Phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind study.1 Eligible patients were ages 55 years or older, had AML, were within four months of achieving first CR or CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation treatment (per investigator preference prior to study entry), and were not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the time of screening. The study enrolled 472 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive either Onureg 300 mg (n=238) or placebo (n=234) orally, once daily, for 14 days of a 28-day cycle, plus best supportive care.

Results showed continued treatment with Onureg significantly improved OS in patients with AML in remission compared to placebo, establishing Onureg as a new continued therapy option for patients who are not able to complete intensive curative therapy, including HSCT. Median OS, the primary endpoint, from time of randomization was greater than two years (24.7 months; 95% CI: 18.7 to 30.5) in the Onureg arm compared to 14.8 months for placebo (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86; p=0.0009). A subgroup analysis showed consistency in the OS benefit for patients in either CR or CRi. The median duration of treatment was 12 cycles (1 to 82) for Onureg1 and 6 cycles with placebo (1 to 76).2

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received Onureg. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received Onureg included pneumonia (8%) and febrile neutropenia (7%). One fatal adverse reaction (sepsis) occurred in a patient who received Onureg. The most common adverse reactions with Onureg versus placebo were nausea (65%, 24%), vomiting (60%, 10%), diarrhea (50%, 21%), fatigue/asthenia (44%, 25%), constipation (39%, 24%), pneumonia (27%, 17%), abdominal pain (22%, 13%) arthralgia (14%, 10%), decreased appetite (13%, 6%), febrile neutropenia (12%, 8%), dizziness (11%, 9%) and pain in extremity (11%, 5%). Of patients who received Onureg, permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients.

Results from the QUAZAR® AML-001 trial were first presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2019.

About AML

There will be nearly 20,000 new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States this year, accounting for 1.1% of all cancer cases, with an estimated 11,180 deaths resulting from the disease. There were an estimated 64,500 people living with AML in the United States in 2017.3 AML is one of the most common acute leukemias in adults. AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells in the bone marrow and as such interferes with normal blood cell production and function. Because of the impaired production of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, it can present with signs of anemia, bleeding and infections.4 AML is a heterogeneous disease associated with diverse genetic mutations, and can rapidly progress and lead to death if not promptly treated.5 AML response to treatment may be of short duration, meaning following patients’ initial response to chemotherapy, there is still a very high risk of relapse, thus representing a significant unmet need for continued therapy options that prolong overall survival.6

About Onureg®

Onureg, the first and only FDA-approved continued AML therapy for patients in remission, is an oral hypomethylating agent that incorporates into DNA and RNA. The main mechanism of action is thought to be hypomethylation of DNA, as well as direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for cell differentiation and proliferation.7,8

INDICATION

ONUREG is indicated for continued treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who achieved first complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following intensive induction chemotherapy and are not able to complete intensive curative therapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATIONS

ONUREG is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to azacitidine or its components.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products: Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the recommended dose and schedule for ONUREG are different from those for the intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine products. Treatment of patients using intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine at the recommended dosage of ONUREG may result in a fatal adverse reaction. Treatment with ONUREG at the doses recommended for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine may not be effective. Do not substitute ONUREG for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine.
Myelosuppression: New or worsening Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 49% and 22% of patients who received ONUREG. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12%. A dose reduction was required for 7% and 2% of patients due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Less than 1% of patients discontinued ONUREG due to either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts and modify the dosage as recommended. Provide standard supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors, if myelosuppression occurs.
Increased Early Mortality in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): In AZA-MDS-003, 216 patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to MDS were randomized to ONUREG or placebo. 107 received a median of 5 cycles of ONUREG 300 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Enrollment was discontinued early due to a higher incidence of early fatal and/or serious adverse reactions in the ONUREG arm compared with placebo. The most frequent fatal adverse reaction was sepsis. Safety and effectiveness of ONUREG for MDS have not been established. Treatment of MDS with ONUREG is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ONUREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine caused fetal death and anomalies in pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal dose less than the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received ONUREG. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% included pneumonia (8%) and febrile neutropenia (7%). One fatal adverse reaction (sepsis) occurred in a patient who received ONUREG.
Most common (≥10%) adverse reactions with ONUREG vs placebo were nausea (65%, 24%), vomiting (60%, 10%), diarrhea (50%, 21%), fatigue/asthenia (44%, 25%), constipation (39%, 24%), pneumonia (27%, 17%), abdominal pain (22%, 13%), arthralgia (14%, 10%), decreased appetite (13%, 6%), febrile neutropenia (12%, 8%), dizziness (11%, 9%), pain in extremity (11%, 5%).
LACTATION

There are no data regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ONUREG and for 1 week after the last dose
Please see full Prescribing Information for ONUREG.

47762,Idorsia Transfers its Agreement with ReveraGen to Santhera for Vamorolone,Santhera Exercises Option to Obtain Worldwide Rights to Vamorolone in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and All Other Indications,"Idorsia transfers its development & commercialization agreement with ReveraGen to Santhera, whereby Santhera shall replace Idorsia as a party to the agreement. Santhera to get an exclusive license, including sublicensing rights, for vamorolone in all indications globally, including Japan and South Korea and a share in expected PR voucher
 In exchange for the revised license rights, Idorsia will receive 366,667 Santhera’s shares and an exchangeable note of $10.9M and is eligible to receive development & commercial milestones on sales of therapy. ReveraGen will receive $7M, in monthly installments of up to $500,000, to fund the ongoing clinical development of vamorolone
 Santhera exercises the option to get global rights to vamorolone in DMD and all other indications. ReveraGen is evaluating Vamorolone in P-IIb VISION-DMD study and expects the completion of enrollment shortly","License gives Santhera worldwide rights to vamorolone, now also including the major markets Japan and South Korea, and paves the way for partnering in additional indications
Agreements with Idorsia and ReveraGen give Santhera immediate control over vamorolone and defer milestone-related payments
Transaction establishes Santhera as a leading company in rare neuromuscular diseases with two late-stage assets addressing the medical need of DMD patients from early to late disease stages
Pratteln, Switzerland, and Rockville, MD, USA, September 2, 2020 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces that it has signed agreements with Idorsia (SIX: IDIA) and ReveraGen BioPharma Inc., making Santhera a direct license holder of vamorolone. Under the agreements, Santhera has obtained an exclusive license from ReveraGen, the originator of vamorolone, for all indications worldwide. The agreements create further value for Santhera through the transfer of rights for the previously excluded markets Japan and South Korea, the right to grant sublicenses and a share in the expected Priority Review Voucher. Vamorolone, a first-in-class anti-inflammatory drug candidate with a novel mode of action, is currently being investigated in the pivotal Phase 2b VISION-DMD study in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by originator ReveraGen and completion of study enrollment is expected shortly.

Under the amended terms, Santhera expects a reduction in cash outflow in the range of USD 18-24 million in the next 12-18 months. In exchange for the revised license rights, Idorsia will receive 366,667 Santhera shares and an exchangeable note in the amount of CHF 10 million and ReveraGen will receive USD 7 million, in monthly instalments of up to USD 500,000, to fund the ongoing clinical development of vamorolone.

Dario Eklund, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera, said: “We are excited about the license transfer of vamorolone to Santhera. Our decision to exercise the option now has been driven by a combination of factors including the availability of encouraging clinical efficacy and safety data with vamorolone, enhanced deal terms and the ability to gain full control over the asset. We look forward to contributing our significant expertise to advancing vamorolone in DMD and exploring additional business development opportunities. We believe that having two promising, complementary, late stage assets for DMD in our pipeline will enable increased access to potentially transformative treatments for a wider patient population. We are grateful to Idorsia, our anchor shareholder, for enabling early access to the license, highlighting its confidence in Santhera as the best suited company to bring vamorolone to patients.”

Eric Hoffman, PhD, Vice President of Research of ReveraGen BioPharma, said: “We are delighted about the revised contractual arrangement and being able to work directly with Santhera as the licensee for vamorolone. Santhera’s experience in both development of DMD drug candidates and the commercialization of a rare disease product positions it well to bring vamorolone to patients. Our work to date clearly shows that vamorolone not only holds the potential to become a new standard of care for patients with DMD but also could benefit patients in a number of other inflammatory diseases.”

The agreements now signed with ReveraGen and Idorsia
Idorsia has assigned its original agreement with ReveraGen to Santhera. Santhera has thus become a direct contracting party with ReveraGen and with a signed early option exercise this allows Santhera to gain exclusive and immediate access to vamorolone and defers some early milestone-related payments until after study readout. Under the terms of the agreements now signed with ReveraGen and Idorsia, Santhera has obtained an exclusive license, including sublicensing rights, for vamorolone in all indications and all territories worldwide, now also including Japan and South Korea. Additionally, ReveraGen is the holder of a Rare Pediatric Disease designation, which may result in receipt of a Priority Review Voucher upon approval of vamorolone for DMD. Santhera will have a share in any revenues of a potential sale of such a voucher.

The license agreements [1] were revised and include the following term amendments:
As consideration for the assignment of its licensing option for vamorolone to Santhera, Idorsia will receive 366,667 Santhera shares, increasing Idorsia’s equity position in Santhera to close to 12%. Milestone payments by Santhera up to and including potential FDA approval will be reduced by USD 18 million to USD 72 million (previously USD 90 million). Santhera’s obligations are a payment of up to USD 7 million, payable in monthly instalments of up to USD 500,000 to ReveraGen, to fund development including the Phase 2b VISION-DMD study; USD 5 million to ReveraGen at the time when FDA supports an NDA filing with Phase 2b 6-month data; a non-interest bearing exchangeable note to Idorsia in the amount of CHF 10 million; and USD 50 million (previously USD 60 million) in total for FDA approval. Since the exchangeable note is payable up to 65% in Santhera shares, at Santhera’s discretion, this could potentially reduce cash outlay by an additional USD 6.5 million. Furthermore, Santhera will receive 10% of any potential proceeds that could arise from the monetization of the expected Priority Review Voucher. Upon achievement of the first USD 100 million revenue, an additional USD 5 million milestone payment is due to Idorsia.

Santhera estimates the peak sales potential for vamorolone for the DMD indication alone to be in excess of USD 500 million in the US and the largest five EU countries.

With Puldysa® and vamorolone, Santhera is building a complementary DMD product portfolio
Vamorolone is in development for young DMD patients requiring an anti-inflammatory, muscle strengthening treatment before onset of respiratory function decline. Based on the cumulative knowledge obtained from extensive non-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical studies with vamorolone, ReveraGen is currently conducting the pivotal Phase 2b VISION-DMD trial and anticipates full study enrollment shortly. Subject to positive results of the first 6-month treatment period, now expected in the second quarter of 2021 due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, this would pave the way for a regulatory submission to the US FDA in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Puldysa (idebenone) for patients with DMD in respiratory function decline who are not taking glucocorticoids is currently under regulatory review in Europe for which Santhera anticipates a CHMP opinion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company expects the combination of vamorolone and Puldysa to address the medical needs of DMD patients, from early to late disease stages, irrespective of age, underlying dystrophin mutation or ambulatory status.

Vamorolone and Puldysa have been granted Orphan Drug status in the US and in Europe, Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the US FDA and Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) status by the UK MHRA. In the UK, Puldysa is available to patients through the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS).

Santhera will further discuss the option exercise in the conference call on the occasion of the publication of the First Half-year Results on September 8, 2020.

[1] Press release “Santhera Enters into Agreement to Acquire Option from Idorsia for Exclusive Sub-License of First-in-class Dissociative Steroid Vamorolone”, November 20, 2018, accessible here.

About Vamorolone – a first-in-class anti-inflammatory drug candidate with a novel mode of action
Vamorolone is a first-in-class drug candidate that binds to the same receptors as corticosteroids but modifies the downstream activity of the receptors. This has the potential to ‘dissociate’ efficacy from typical steroid safety concerns and therefore could emerge as a valuable alternative to corticosteroids, the current standard of care in children and adolescent patients with DMD. There is a clear unmet medical need in this patient group as high dose corticosteroids have significant systemic side effects that detract from patient quality of life. Vamorolone is being developed by US-based ReveraGen BioPharma Inc. with participation in funding and design of studies by several international non-profit foundations, the US National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Defense and the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 program.

About Santhera
Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) is a Swiss specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines for rare neuromuscular and pulmonary diseases with high unmet medical need. Santhera is building a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) product portfolio to treat patients from early to late disease stages, irrespective of causative mutations, ambulatory status or age. A marketing authorization application for Puldysa® (idebenone) is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency. Santhera has an exclusive license for all indications worldwide to vamorolone, a first-in-class anti-inflammatory drug candidate with novel mode of action, currently investigated in a pivotal study in patients with DMD as an alternative to standard corticosteroids. The clinical stage pipeline also includes lonodelestat (POL6014) to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) and other neutrophilic pulmonary diseases, as well as omigapil and an exploratory gene therapy approach targeting congenital muscular dystrophies. Santhera out-licensed ex-North American rights to its first approved product, Raxone® (idebenone), for the treatment of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) to Chiesi Group.

In 2015, Formycon AG signed an exclusive global license agreement with Santo Holding (Deutschland) GmbH for FYB203","The MAGELLAN-AMD study investigates the comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Formycon’s aflibercept biosimilar candidate FYB203 and the reference product Eylea®1 in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)
Global development program highlights leading position of Formycon and Bioeq in the field of ophthalmologic biosimilars
Munich – Formycon AG (ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8/ WKN: A1EWVY) and Bioeq GmbH have today announced the launch of the randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III study for FYB203, a biosimilar candidate to Eylea®. The aim of the clinical study is to demonstrate the comparability of FYB203 and the reference product Eylea® in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Also known as wet AMD, this is one of the main causes of loss of vision in people over the age of 50 in developed countries. The study design was developed in agreement with the US drug authority (FDA), the European regulatory authority (EMA) and the Japanese regulatory authority (PMDA) and is intended to support the approval process in these regions. Bioeq GmbH, a company of the ATHOS Group, is the sponsor of the phase III study.

The active ingredient aflibercept (Eylea®) inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is responsible for the excessive formation of blood vessels in the retina, which leads to a progressive loss of vision. Eylea® is the highest-selling drug in the field of age-related eye disease and in 2019 achieved revenues of around US$ 7.5 billion. In 2015, Formycon AG concluded an exclusive global licensing agreement for FYB203 with Santo Holding (Deutschland) GmbH.

Formycon’s COO, Dr. Stefan Glombitza, sees the company’s leading position in ophthalmologic biosimilar development being confirmed: “We are delighted that our second project in the field of ophthalmology is now starting the phase III study. Given the extensive experience from the FYB201 project and the successful cooperation with Bioeq GmbH, we are confident that we will also be able to develop a high-quality and cost-effective biosimilar with FYB203. The active ingredient, aflibercept, is an extremely effective and proven treatment for wet macular degeneration and we want to play our part in ensuring that as many patients as possible gain access to this treatment option.”

1 Eylea® is a registered trademark of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.

About Formycon:
Formycon is a leading, independent developer of high-quality biopharmaceutical medicines, especially biosimilars. The company focuses on treatments in ophthalmology, immunology and on other key chronic diseases, covering the entire value chain from technical development to the clinical phase III as well as the preparation of dossiers for marketing approval. With its biosimilars, Formycon is making a major contribution towards providing as many patients as possible with access to vital and affordable medicines. Formycon currently has four biosimilars in development. Based on its extensive experience in the development of biopharmaceutical drugs, the company is also working on the development of antibody-based COVID-19 compounds.

About Bioeq:

Bioeq was founded in 2014 and is a leading service provider in the development of biopharmaceutical follow-on products, known as biosimilars. Working with various partners, Bioeq develops third-wave biosimilars and specializes in ophthalmic agents. The development programs meet the standards for highly regulated markets such as Europe, the USA, Canada, or Japan, and are therefore suitable for global licensing. Bioeq’s expertise lies primarily in comprehensive project management, clinical development, the drafting of licensing strategies in dialog with the authorities, the development of application systems for administering the products, the drawing-up of patent strategies, and in license management. Bioeq is currently working on five different biosimilar projects.

About Biosimilars:
Since their introduction in the 1980s, biopharmaceuticals have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and eye diseases. In the coming years, many of these biotech drugs will lose their patent protection – and by 2020, medications with revenues of approximately USD 100 billion will be off patent.

Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, for which exclusivity has expired. They are approved via stringent regulatory pathways in highly regulated markets (such as EU, US, Japan, Canada, Australia) based on proven similarity of the biosimilar with the originator biopharmaceutical reference product. While the global market for biosimilars is currently more than USD 5.0 billion, industry experts expect this figure to grow up to USD 30 billion by the year 2025.

BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, Aug. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sandoz Canada Inc. announces it has reached a negotiated agreement with the Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) and launched Ziextenzo® (pegfilgrastim, reference biologic drug: Neulasta®) and Riximyo® (rituximab, reference biologic drug: Rituxan®) in Canadian hospitals and pharmacies. This follows the recent approval of the two biosimilars by Health Canada.

Ziextenzo® (pegfilgrastim) was approved by Health Canada on April 21, 2020. It is a long-acting form of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF), or filgrastim. The use of Ziextenzo® has been approved to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive antineoplastic agents. Neutropenia is one of the most serious side effects of chemotherapy1.

Riximyo® (rituximab) was approved by Health Canada on April 28, 2020. It belongs to a family of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that are produced to bind to another protein, called an antigen. Riximyo® has been approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Pursuing the pCPA agreement, Riximyo® is now reimbursed in Ontario effective July, 2020  through Limited Use as well as Exceptional Access Program for certain indications, and funding in hospitals will be provided by Cancer Care Ontario. In addition, British Columbia has recently announced the reimbursement of Riximyo® effective August 1, 2020 through BC Cancer.

“We are very pleased with British Columbia’s and Ontario’s decision for improving access and offering public reimbursement to this treatment for patients in need of rituximab” said Michel Robidoux, President and General Manager of Sandoz Canada. “Sandoz is a global leader and a pioneer in biosimilars research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. As such, we have a vertically integrated model. The addition of Ziextenzo® and Riximyo® in Canada will provide greater access to Canadian patients in the immunology and oncology areas.”

“In addition to our agreement with the Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance for both biosimilars, we are currently working with individual provinces to include these medicines on formulary coverage. This is great news for patients and their healthcare professionals as we expand biologic treatment options for patients with life-threatening or serious debilitating conditions. The launches also allow for a broader use of biosimilars that can help reduce growing costs to the healthcare system and generate savings that can be reinvested in healthcare resources,” explains Karine Matteau, Vice President, Bio-Generic Hospital/Physician channel and Head Biosimilars at Sandoz Canada.

A patient support program will be available to patients treated by these biosimilars, providing guidance with reimbursement navigation, financial assistance, administrative support, as well as education for patients.

About Biosimilars
As patents and data protection expire for original-brand medicines, other manufacturers may produce new versions of the biologic medicines called biosimilars. To receive Health Canada authorization, a biosimilar must demonstrate it is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety compared to an original-brand (“reference”) biologic2. Since 2009, Health Canada has approved 24 biosimilars of original-brand biologics present on the Canadian market3.

The Patented Medicines Pricing Review Board has estimated that private and public drug plans across Canada could save from $332 million CDN to $1.81 billion CDN in the third year following biosimilar entry across a portfolio of product4. The broader use of biosimilar medicines, including the implementation of biosimilar switching policies, can also help public and private drug plans improve their sustainability by adding new medicine listings and expanding existing medication coverage for patients.

Sanofi and GSK initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trial of COVID-19 adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine candidate

Pre-clinical studies show promising safety and immunogenicity.
Over 400 participants being enrolled in Phase 1/2 study
Pending positive Phase 1/2 data, companies aim to move into Phase 3 by end of 2020
Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant with the target of producing up to one billion doses in 2021
PARIS and LONDON – Sept. 3, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK today started the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate, developed in partnership by Sanofi and GSK, uses the same recombinant protein-based technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines with GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant technology.

The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity (tolerability) and immunogenicity (immune response) of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A total of 440 healthy adults are being enrolled in the trial across 11 investigational sites in the United States.

The companies anticipate first results early December 2020 which will support the initiation of a Phase 3 trial in December 2020. If data are sufficient for licensure application, the plan is to request regulatory approval in the first half of 2021.

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Preclinical data showed an acceptable reactogenicity profile and data based on two injections of the adjuvanted recombinant vaccine showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies that are comparable to levels in humans who recovered from the COVID-19 infection. Pre-clinical results will be published later this year. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant with the target of producing up to one billion doses in 2021.

“Sanofi and GSK bring proven science and technology to the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic, with the shared objective of delivering a safe and effective vaccine,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “The initiation of our clinical study is an important step and brings us closer to a potential vaccine which could help defeat COVID-19. Our dedicated teams and partner continue to work around the clock as we aim to deliver the first results in early December. Positive data will enable a prompt start of the pivotal phase 3 trial by the end of this year.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, “Moving this vaccine candidate into clinical development is an important moment in the progress towards addressing the global pandemic we are all facing. This builds on the confidence shown by governments already in the potential of this protein-based adjuvanted vaccine candidate, which utilizes established technology from both companies, and can be produced at scale by two of the leading vaccine manufacturers globally. We now look forward to the data from the study, and if positive, beginning Phase 3 by the end of the year.”

The development of the adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate is being supported through funding and a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally

In July 2020, Sanofi and GSK announced a collaborative effort with the U.S. government to supply up to 100 million doses of their COVID-19 recombinant protein-based vaccine to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed goal of making hundreds of millions of doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States as quickly as possible. The U.S. government has a further option to discuss the purchase of up to 500 million doses longer term. Both companies also agreed (subject to final contract) with the UK government to supply up to 60 million doses of recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.

The partners plan to supply a significant portion of total worldwide available supply in 2021/2022 to COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator (Access to COVID‐19 Tools), a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is developing a messenger RNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. With several innovative vaccine platforms currently being investigated across the industry, mRNA is considered among the most promising. Preclinical data shows that two immunizations of the mRNA vaccine induced high neutralizing antibody levels that are comparable to the upper range of those observed in infected humans. Sanofi expects the Phase 1/2 study to start in November, with earliest potential approval in the second half of 2021. Translate Bio has established mRNA manufacturing capacity and Sanofi expects to be able to supply annual capacity of 90 to 360 million doses.

Highlight Therapeutics announces first patient dosed in Phase IIa study in liver metastasis

Second collaboration with MSD to evaluate combination of BO-112 and KEYTRUDA®

New research studies may further accelerate delivery of novel treatment strategies for melanoma
MADRID, Spain, Sept. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Highlight Therapeutics (“Highlight”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing RNA-based therapies against cancer, announces it has entered into a second Phase II trial collaboration with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, U.S.A., known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada.

The collaboration will focus on the Phase II evaluation of the combination of BO-112, Highlight’s lead program, and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients that have progressed on anti-PD-1-based therapy in refractory advanced malignant melanoma.

The incidence of malignant melanoma is estimated to be 3-5 cases per 100,000 individuals in Europe. Activating therapeutic anti-tumor immunity by the modulation of the host immune system has become a key approach for treating melanoma. Antagonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against immune inhibitory molecules such as CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4) and PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) have improved the prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma and have been incorporated into oncology treatment guidelines as a standard of care. However, most patients treated in this way do not achieve a clinical response and many of those who do respond eventually develop progressive disease.

The trial, named Spotlight 203, will evaluate the combination of stimulation of the innate immune system by direct intra-tumoral administration of BO-112, combined with systemic administration of pembrolizumab, based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response or partial response as primary endpoint.

Spotlight 203 will also seek to further characterize the clinical activity of intra-tumoral BO-112 in combination with pembrolizumab by evaluating disease control rates, duration of response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. A total of 40 patients are planned to be enrolled. The sample size for a subsequent randomized portion of the study will be determined based on efficacy results.

Marisol Quintero, CEO of Highlight Therapeutics, commented: “Spotlight 203 is designed to address the high unmet need of patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who have failed anti-PD-1 therapy. Phase 1 data suggest the potential of BO-112 to sensitize the immune system against the tumor, including enhanced sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment. Based on clinical and pre-clinical studies, we believe intra- tumoral BO-112 has the potential to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We are pleased to build on our fruitful collaboration with MSD, whose extensive expertise in immune-oncology makes them the ideal partner.

“This partnership seeks to accelerate the development of therapies for patients with malignant melanoma. We are delighted to commence Spotlight 203 and to be able to combine our capabilities to accelerate the research of medicines in diseases with such a poor prognosis.”

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ. A Phase 2 clinical study of intra-tumoral BO-112 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with liver metastases from colorectal or gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancer is also currently underway.

About melanoma
Almost 288,000 new cases of melanoma and more than 60,000 deaths were estimated worldwide in 2018 [Ferlay 2019]. In North America, melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in males and sixth most common cancer in females [Siegel 2018]. In the U.S, it is estimated that more than 100,000 patients will be diagnosed with melanoma in 2020, with almost 7,000 deaths recorded. Advanced or metastatic melanoma (unresectable Stage III, Stage IV) remains a lethal disease with a high proportion of patients resistant to approved therapies. There are currently limited treatment options for patients who progress on targeted therapy or immunotherapy, creating a high unmet need for novel therapies for advanced melanoma patients who have failed existing treatments.

About Highlight Therapeutics
Highlight, formerly known as Bioncotech Therapeutics S.L, is a private, clinical-stage company dedicated to unlocking the full potential of immuno-oncology. Its lead drug candidate BO-112 is a best-in-class RNA-based therapy which has been demonstrated to initiate a powerful immune response, leveraging a unique multi- target approach to turn ‘cold’ tumors ‘hot’ and therefore visible to the immune system. It has the potential to rescue patients who are resistant to current checkpoint inhibitor therapy, a very large market opportunity. BO-112 is currently being investigated in a range of clinical trials as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to in-house research, Highlight Therapeutics has a number of external collaborators, including Merck & Co and UCLA.

treatment alone. The study in hospitalized patients with influenza A and the parallel Phase
3 study of pimodivir in outpatients with influenza A will be halted.
“While our goal was to develop an innovative new treatment option for patients at risk of
respiratory infections, unfortunately these data show that pimodivir does not offer a
benefit above the existing standard of care,” said James Merson, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic
Area Head for Infectious Diseases at Janssen Research & Development. “At Janssen, we
have a deep heritage of caring for those affected by respiratory infectious diseases and
will continue to do so, focusing on clinical development programs that we believe will offer
transformational medical innovation to patients.”
Pimodivir Phase 3 study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pimodivir in
Page 2 of 3
two Phase 3 trials in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatment in hospitalized
adolescent, adult and elderly participants with influenza A infection (NCT03376321, known
as 3001), and in non-hospitalized adolescent, adult, and elderly participants with influenza
A infection who are at risk of developing complications (NCT03381196, known as 3002).
The Company is in the process of informing all study investigators and relevant health
authorities.
This decision was reached in consultation with the Biomedical Advanced Research and
Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
and co-funder for the program. The pimodivir development program received funding
support from BARDA under contract HHSO100201500014C.
In 2014, Janssen entered into an exclusive license agreement with Vertex for the
worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of pimodivir.

DEERFIELD, Ill. – August 31, 2020

Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global innovator in renal care, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the De Novo application for Theranova, the company’s novel dialysis membrane. Theranova was designed to deliver expanded hemodialysis (HDx) therapy, which filters a wider range of molecules from the blood than traditional hemodialysis (HD) filters, like high-flux membranes, by targeting effective removal of conventional (500 Da to 25 kDa) and large middle molecules (25 kDa to 45 kDa) 3,4,5. These middle molecules may be associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease in patients with kidney failure3,4,5.

By granting a De Novo application, the FDA is establishing a new class of dialyzer technology with unique performance standards. The FDA utilizes the De Novo pathway for low and moderate risk medical devices that have no existing predicate in the United States; such designations are rare in the dialysis space. In fact, less than 1% of devices granted marketing authorization under De Novo have been for the care of patients with kidney failure since the pathway’s inception in 1997.

HDx is performed the same way as conventional HD, with only a change of the dialyzer membrane required. Once in the machine, the Theranova dialyzer’s innovative Medium Cut-Off® membrane combines high permeability and selectivity for uremic toxins (up to 45 kDa), while retaining essential proteins and maintaining albumin levels during treatment2,3. This unique cut-off and high retention onset profile expands clearance, allowing for filtration closer to that of the natural kidney2,6.

“U.S. patients on HD deserve more options than are currently available to them, and we are taking extraordinary steps to support their access to Theranova,” said Gavin Campbell, general manager of Baxter’s U.S. Renal Care business. “Patients are currently treated with HDx enabled by Theranova in more than 40 countries worldwide, and we are doing everything we can in the U.S. to ensure healthcare providers can also realize the full value of this therapy for their patients on HD.”

To date, over 90 independent and Baxter-led or sponsored studies have been conducted on HDx therapy enabled by Theranova. The studies evaluated a range of clinical and quality-of-life measures, including the ability to clear conventional and large middle molecules, albumin retention, chronic inflammation and other side effects of standard HD therapy.

“Individually, the side effects from standard HD, which patients typically undertake three days a week, four hours per day, may seem manageable. However, the chronic effects of treatment accumulate and over time, cause some patients to give up on therapy,” explained Mary Gellens, M.D., nephrologist and senior medical director at Baxter. “HDx therapy enabled by Theranova is a promising alternative to what is currently available because it delivers a filtration profile that is closer to the natural kidney.”

Due to the novel nature of Theranova, Baxter conducted a randomized controlled clinical study in the United States that evaluated the safety and efficacy of HDx therapy enabled by Theranova. During the study, as reported during the 2019 American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week, 172 hemodialysis patients received therapy with either a medium cut-off dialyzer (Theranova 400) or a high-flux dialyzer (ELISIO-17H) over 24 weeks of treatment, with a primary efficacy endpoint measuring the reduction ratio of lambda (λ) free light chains at 24 weeks of treatment, while maintaining pre-dialysis serum albumin levels. Data from the study, which was just published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN), found that expanded hemodialysis therapy with the Theranova 400 dialyzer provides superior removal of large middle molecules, as exemplified by λ free light chains, as compared to a similarly sized high flux dialyzer while maintaining serum albumin levels7. Large middle molecules are a diverse group of uremic toxins that are believed to contribute to the high cardiovascular disease burden in end stage kidney disease8. Dialysis technologies available to date offer limited clearance of these molecules8. The ability to efficiently remove these large middle molecules provides dialysis patients with a new alternative therapy.

About Theranova

Launched outside of the U.S. in 2016, Theranova is currently available in 44 countries across Europe, Latin America, Asia, and in Canada, and used in more than 850 clinics globally.

CAMBRIDGE, England & BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bicycle Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: BCYC), a biotechnology company pioneering a new and differentiated class of therapeutics based on its proprietary bicyclic peptide (Bicycle®) technology, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase IIa expansion portion of the Phase I/IIa trial sponsored by Cancer Research UK, the world’s leading cancer charity dedicated to saving lives through research. The trial is evaluating BT1718 in patients with MT1-MMP-positive squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a basket of other MT1-MMP-positive solid tumors.

“We’re delighted to be sponsoring this Phase IIa trial of BT1718. Looking to the future, we believe BT1718 has the potential to create an entirely new treatment option for people with non-small cell lung cancer and other solid cancers whose therapeutic need is unaddressed by current medicines.”

“With the Phase IIa expansion, we look forward to building on the encouraging data generated through the Phase I dose escalation, in which BT1718 appeared tolerable with manageable adverse events and preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity were observed,” said Kevin Lee, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Bicycle Therapeutics. “BT1718 is a Bicycle Toxin Conjugate, or BTC, that targets the antigen MT1-MMP, which was observed in our translational research to be highly expressed on the membrane of tumors of a squamous cell origin. Squamous NSCLC represents a key patient segment where there is a high unmet need for new treatment options, given the limitations of current therapies. We believe BT1718 represents a potential first-in-class therapy that could have significant potential in the treatment of squamous NSCLC, as well as more broadly across other MT1-MMP-expressing cancers with high unmet need.”

BT1718 is a BTC targeting MT1-MMP and is comprised of a mono-hindered disulfide cleavable linker and a cytotoxic DM1 payload. The Phase IIa expansion will evaluate BT1718 administered once weekly at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of 20 mg/m2 in an MT1-MMP-positive squamous NSCLC cohort, as well as in an MT1-MMP-positive solid tumor “basket” cohort. For the first time in the Phase I/IIa trial, patients will be preselected based on levels of antigen expression in target lesions, as determined by the Company’s proprietary clinical-grade MT1-MMP immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The primary objectives of the Phase IIa expansion portion are to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of BT1718. One of the secondary objectives is to assess anti-tumor response, as measured by RECIST criteria. The trial is sponsored by Cancer Research UK’s Centre for Drug Development and will be conducted at sites in the UK.

Dr. Nigel Blackburn, Cancer Research UK’s Director of Drug Development, said: “We’re delighted to be sponsoring this Phase IIa trial of BT1718. Looking to the future, we believe BT1718 has the potential to create an entirely new treatment option for people with non-small cell lung cancer and other solid cancers whose therapeutic need is unaddressed by current medicines.”

 The P-III study demonstrated that additional doses led to further benefits in A1C (-17% & -19% vs -1.5%) and bodyweight reduction (-8.8 & -10.4 vs -6.8 pounds) @36wks. in people with inadequately controlled T2D on concomitant metformin therapy respectively
 The P-III study results are under EMA’s review for approval, expected this year. The additional doses of Trulicity will be available in US’ pharmacies later this month","AWARD-11 showed 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg doses led to additional blood sugar control; as a secondary endpoint, both doses also led to weight

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved two additional doses of Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) Trulicity® (dulaglutide). The approval expands the label of once-weekly Trulicity to include 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg doses based on data from AWARD-11. The phase 3 trial showed the additional doses led to further benefits in A1C and body weight reduction when compared to Trulicity 1.5 mg in people with type 2 diabetes.

“The FDA’s decision to approve the additional doses of Trulicity is a positive step forward for people living with type 2 diabetes and their care teams,” said Juan Pablo Frias, M.D., Medical Director and Principal Investigator, National Research Institute. “This progressive condition can require different treatment approaches over time, and findings from AWARD-11 showed the additional doses of Trulicity can lead to further A1C and weight reductions for people with type 2 diabetes whose current treatment may no longer be meeting their needs.”

The AWARD-11 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of additional doses of Trulicity (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) compared to Trulicity 1.5 mg, using two different statistical approaches[i]. The efficacy estimand, which analyzes participants who remained on treatment throughout the trial, showed both doses led to significant reductions in A1C and weight:

4.5 mg (A1C: -1.9 percent, weight: -10.4 pounds)
3.0 mg (A1C: -1.7 percent; weight: -8.8 pounds)
1.5 mg (A1C: -1.5 percent; weight: -6.8 pounds)
“People find the Trulicity pen simple and easy-to-use,” said Leonard Glass, M.D., F.A.C.E, vice president of Medical Affairs, Lilly. “Now, with the 3.0 and 4.5 doses available, people with type 2 diabetes who use Trulicity can benefit from additional A1C and weight loss as their condition progresses.”

The additional doses of Trulicity will be available in United States pharmacies in late September.

Results from AWARD-11 are also under review by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, with an opinion on whether to recommend approval by the European Commission expected this year.

About the AWARD-11 Study

The phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel arm study included 1,842 participants with type 2 diabetes and evaluated the efficacy and safety of two investigational doses of dulaglutide (3.0 mg and 4.5 mg) compared to Trulicity 1.5 mg. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that a once-weekly investigational dulaglutide dose (3.0 mg and/or 4.5 mg) was superior to the approved Trulicity 1.5 mg dose, as measured by A1C reduction from baseline, at 36 weeks in people with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on concomitant metformin therapy. The primary and secondary objectives could be met if one or both doses achieved statistical significance for the endpoints. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included change from baseline in mean body weight and fasting serum glucose (FSG), percentage of patients reaching an A1C goal of less than seven percent and occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes and pharmacokinetics at steady-state through 36 and 52 weeks. All participants started the study at a dose of Trulicity 0.75 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of once-weekly 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg (via a 1.5 mg step) or 4.5 mg (via steps at 1.5 mg and 3.0 mg).

Test for use on high-throughput cobas 6800/8800 Systems will continue to support high volume testing 
This test is also available in markets accepting the CE mark

Basel, 04 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test is intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and Influenza B in patients suspected by their healthcare provider of having respiratory viral infection consistent with COVID-19. Additionally, it is available in markets accepting the CE mark.

“With the approaching flu season, this new test is particularly important as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections can hardly be differentiated by symptoms alone. Now, with a single test, healthcare professionals can confidently provide the right diagnosis and most effective treatment plan for their patients,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “As a leader in diagnostics testing solutions, this launch demonstrates our ongoing commitment to stop the spread of serious infectious diseases by increasing access to accurate, reliable and efficient testing options.”

Roche’s widely-available, fully-automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems, which are used to perform the SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test, offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms. The systems provide up to 96 results in about 3 hours and 384 results for the cobas 6800 System and 1,056 results for the cobas 8800 System in an 8-hour shift. Roche is committed to delivering as many tests as possible within the limits of supply.

The test is another key addition to the comprehensive Roche diagnostic portfolio to help healthcare providers combat COVID-19 and make informed decisions for optimised patient care. Currently, this portfolio includes molecular, serology and digital solutions, which help during the initial stages of infection, during the recovery phase, as well as following the resolution of infection.

About cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test is a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus, and Influenza B virus in nasal or nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from individuals suspected of a respiratory infection, and is not intended for the detection of Influenza C virus. Under FDA EUA, the test can be taken by individuals suspected of a respiratory viral infection like COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. The test runs on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems and has a full-process negative control, positive control and internal control. Multiplexing will increase lab efficiency and save resources in the labs.

Negative results do not preclude infection from SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza virus and should not be used as the sole basis of treatment or other patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history and epidemiological information.

The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures. In the United States, the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test for use on the cobas® 6800 and  cobas® 8800 Systems is only for use under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization.

About Emergency Use Authorization status
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Test has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorised by the FDA under an EUA for use by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform moderate and high complexity tests. The test has been authorised only for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus, Influenza A virus, and Influenza B virus and not any other viruses or pathogens. It is only authorised for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorisation of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 virus, Influenza A, and Influenza B under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb- 3(b)(1), unless the authorisation is terminated or revoked sooner.

About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.1

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.

To control the spread of the infection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as distribution partner, to our portfolio, that allows the detection of antibodies against Covid-19 at the point of care. On 1 September we announced that we will launch a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, in late September, for markets accepting the CE Mark. We also intend to file for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is for use in point of care settings for both symptomatic and asymptomatic people.
Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

About Influenza A and B (flu)
Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by infection with the influenza virus. Influenza viruses consist of three types: Influenza A, Influenza B, and Influenza C. In the U.S., Influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and Influenza B are the predominant seasonal viruses. Influenza A and B viruses are among the leading causes of respiratory infections, estimated to affect 5-10% of adults and 20-30% of children every year worldwide. Influenza is primarily spread by breathing in infected droplets formed when a person with the flu sneezes, coughs, or talks. Symptoms include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, sore throat, and runny nose. Elderly people, young children and people with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions can be at high risk for serious disease. Each year, approximately 3 to 5 million people develop severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 people die from the flu.2

47881,"Innovent's Sulinno (biosimilar, adalimumab) Receives NMPA's Approval for Autoimmune Diseases",Innovent Announces NMPA Granted Marketing Approval for SULINNO (Adalimumab Injection) in China,"The NMPA has approved Sulinno for the treatment of RA, AS, and psoriasis in China. The approval of the Sulinno marks the expansion of Innovent’s portfolio in the non-oncology field
 Sulinno has similar clinical efficacy and safety to its reference product, Humira. The launch will provide Chinese patients with affordable adalimumab, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients
 Sulinno is a biosimilar referencing Humira and is the third mAb approved by NMPA following the approval of Tyvyt (sintilimab) and Byvasda (bevacizumab)","SAN FRANCISCO, U.S. and SUZHOU, China, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that SULINNO® (adalimumab injection), a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody drug, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis in China. SULINNO® is Innovent’s third monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection). The approval of SULINNO® marks the expansion of Innovent’s marketed products into the non-oncology field.

There are nearly 20 million patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriasis in China. Not only does this type of disease cause a decrease in these patients’ physical function, life quality and social participation, but also brings heavy economic burden to their families and the society. Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved worldwide for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn’s disease (including pediatric crohn’s disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab has been well recognized globally. Adalimumab injection is widely used in the North America and Europe. It has been consistently recommended in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these diseases, and its significant efficacy has been universally recognized. However, as the cost of the injection still exceeds the affordability of many ordinary patients, the use of adalimumab remains limited in China. SULINNO®, a adalimumab biosimilar has similar clinical efficacy and safety to adalimumab, and its clinical results were published in the Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019. The launch of SULINNO® will provide more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients.

Dr. Michael Yu, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent, stated: “As an example of our success with the National Major New Drug Innovation and Development Projects, SULINNO® is the third monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection), and the first drug marketed among Innovent’s non-oncology pipeline. The launch of SULINNO® once again fulfilled our mission to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceutical products that are affordable to ordinary people. We hope that this product will benefit more and more patients and families in need and improve their quality of life.”

About SULINNO®

SULINNO® is an adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar and a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by activated macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Anti-TNF-α antibody can bind to human TNF-α monomer or trimer, block TNF-α binding to the cellular surface receptor, p55 and p75, and neutralize the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α, thereby inhibiting the release of TNF-α mediated inflammatory factors and cytokines, the adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation of fibroblasts and the activation of osteoclasts. Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved globally for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn’s disease (including pediatric crohn’s disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc., and its efficacy and safety has been well recognized worldwide. The results of a complete pre-clinical comparison showed that SULINNO® has similar in vitro biological activity (binding activity to target antigen TNF-α and neutralizing activity), physicochemical property and pharmacokinetic characteristics to those of Humira®. The similarities were also demonstrated in pharmacological and toxicological studies. The head-to-head clinical study comparing SULINNO® and Humira® conducted in patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a clinical similarity. The study results were published at Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019.

– Esprit BTK was granted breakthrough device designation by the U.S. FDA
– There are no stents or drug-coated balloons currently approved for use below the knee in the U.S.
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the start of the LIFE-BTK clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the company’s new Esprit™ BTK Everolimus Eluting Resorbable Scaffold System. This is the first Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial in the U.S. to evaluate a fully resorbable device to treat blocked arteries below the knees, or critical limb ischemia (CLI), in people battling advanced stages of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The first patient was enrolled by Danielle Bajakian, M.D., a vascular surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

“Far too many people are impacted by peripheral artery disease, and this new drug-eluting resorbable scaffold is needed to offer meaningful improvements in how this disease is treated,” said Nick West, M.D., divisional vice president, Medical Affairs, and chief medical officer in Abbott’s vascular business. “Patients treated with balloon angioplasty often require repeat procedures on treated arteries, and therefore a drug-eluting resorbable device is ideally-suited to provide mechanical support for the vessel, reduce the chance of vessel re-narrowing and then gradually disappear over time.”

For people with CLI, blocked vessels impair blood flow to the lower extremities, which can lead to severe pain, wounds, and in some cases, limb amputation. Globally, more than 200 million1 people suffer from PAD, disproportionally affecting people in underserved communities. Worse, up to 40% of patients with CLI currently undergo amputations,2 many of which could be prevented by eliminating health care disparities.

Currently, the standard of care for patients battling CLI is balloon angioplasty, which relies on a small balloon delivered via a catheter to the blockage to compress it against the arterial wall, opening the vessel and restoring blood flow. However, blockages treated only with balloon angioplasty have poor short- and long-term results, and in many instances the vessels become blocked again, requiring additional treatment.

There are no drug-eluting stents (DES), drug-coated balloons (DCB) or bare-metal stents (BMS) approved for use below the knee (BTK) in the U.S. With the limited options for BTK, new treatment options are needed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Esprit BTK breakthrough device designation, which streamlines review and pre-market approval timelines.

Unlike traditional metal stents, Abbott’s Esprit BTK System is not a permanent implant; it provides support to an artery immediately after a balloon angioplasty, preventing the vessel from reclosing. Once implanted, the scaffold delivers a drug over a few months that promotes healing and keeps the artery open. The scaffold is naturally resorbed into the body over time, like dissolving sutures, and ultimately leaves only a healed artery behind. Abbott is a pioneer in bioresorbable scaffolds. Long-term clinical data from a meta-analysis of randomized Absorb trials suggested that bioresorbable scaffolds might be an acceptable alternative to metallic DES for many patients with coronary artery disease.3

“After a five-year feasibility study in assessing treatment of arteries below the knee with a different version of this technology, the outcomes suggest resorbable devices have significant potential to become the favored therapy for CLI patients,” said Ramon Varcoe, MBBS MS FRACS Ph.D., University New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, and one of the principal investigators in the trial. “This technology offers the best of both worlds. The device provides a strong scaffold structure and delivers antiproliferative drugs, then disappears and is not an impediment for future interventions, surgery or imaging.”

Once fully enrolled, the LIFE-BTK trial will evaluate the Esprit BTK resorbable scaffold in 225 patients at centers around the world. The study is the first of its kind and an evolution of prior studies examining resorbable technology in treating diseased vessels and blocked arteries.

About the LIFE-BTK Trial
The LIFE-BTK trial is the first Investigational Device Exemption trial in the U.S. to evaluate a fully dissolvable device to treat critical limb ischemia in people battling advanced stages of peripheral artery disease (PAD).  To date, the trial has sites in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States.

The LIFE-BTK trial is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing Esprit BTK to Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA).  The study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy in CLI patients with up to two lesions in separate infrapopliteal vessels, one of three types of vessels found below the knee and the type most commonly affected by CLI.

The trial will be led by principal investigators Brian DeRubertis, M.D. (vascular surgeon, UCLA), Sahil Parikh M.D., (interventional cardiologist, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who serves on the medical advisory board for Abbott’s vascular division), and Ramon Varcoe MBBS MS FRACS Ph.D., (University New South Wales, Sydney, Australia).

About the Esprit BTK System
The Esprit BTK System consists of a thin strutted scaffold which measures 99 microns made from poly-L-lactide (PLLA), a semi-crystalline bioresorbable polymer engineered to resist vessel recoil and provide a platform for drug delivery. The scaffold is uniformly coated with poly-D, L-lactide (PDLLA) and the cytostatic drug, everolimus. PDLLA is an amorphous bioresorbable polymer coating designed to allow controlled drug release. The controlled release of everolimus, a drug that acts to retard cell proliferation, reduces scar tissue growth in the affected area, which can cause vessel blockage. The Esprit BTK System is an investigational device only in the U.S.

About Critical Limb Ischemia
Critical limb ischemia is a severe form of PAD that is characterized by chronic pain, even at rest, as well as ulcers and gangrene (tissue death) that develop as a result of chronically poor blood flow to the lower limbs. The most common endovascular treatment of below-the-knee arteries is balloon angioplasty, which opens narrowed arteries with a catheter-guided balloon. For some patients, surgical bypass procedures are performed. If left untreated, the disease can eventually lead to amputation and limb loss.

I-Mab to host call for investors on September 4 at 8:00am ET
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., and SHANGHAI, Sept. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and I-Mab (Nasdaq: IMAB) announced today that AbbVie and I-Mab have signed a broad, global collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab (also known as TJC4), an innovative anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody internally discovered and developed by I-Mab for the treatment of multiple cancers. In addition, the two partners have the potential to expand the collaboration to additional transformative therapies.

Lemzoparlimab is one of the leading drug candidates among I-Mab’s proprietary and innovative pipeline. It is designed to minimize inherent binding to normal red blood cells while preserving its strong anti-tumor activity, a critical attribute in potentially differentiating lemzoparlimab from other antibodies of the same class currently in development. Topline results of the recent phase 1 clinical trial confirm possible differentiation of lemzoparlimab in drug safety and a more favorable pharmacokinetics profile in cancer patients. Results have shown that lemzoparlimab is well tolerated as a single agent at a dose range of up to 30 mg/kg without any priming dose. In all DLT-evaluable patients, no dose-limiting toxicities or severe hematologic adverse events were observed. Full data will be presented at an appropriate scientific conference later this year.

“Cancer is the second-leading cause of death globally and the need for novel cancer therapies has never been more acute. The addition of I-Mab’s novel CD47 programs complements our global clinical strategy in hematology and immuno-oncology,” said Thomas J. Hudson, M.D., senior vice president of R&D and chief scientific officer, AbbVie. “We have been impressed with what I-Mab has been able to accomplish in research and clinical development and we look forward to working together to make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of patients globally.”

“At the forefront of drug innovation, our goal at I-Mab has always been to bring transformational therapies to patients globally. This strategic collaboration reinforces I-Mab’s leading position in immuno-oncology and enables us to realize the full potential of our innovation,” said Jingwu Zang, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, Honorary Chairman and Director of I-Mab. “We are extremely proud to partner with AbbVie. By leveraging the combined development strength of our companies, we aim to speed lemzoparlimab to market for patients in need around the world.”

Collaboration Details
The collaboration established today provides AbbVie with an exclusive global license, excluding greater China, to develop and commercialize lemzoparlimab. Both companies will collaborate to design and conduct further global clinical trials to evaluate lemzoparlimab in multiple cancers. I-Mab retains all rights to develop and to commercialize lemzoparlimab in mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong. The collaboration also allows for potential collaboration on future CD47-related therapeutic agents. Each party will have the opportunity subject to further licenses to explore each other’s related programs in their respective territories.

The companies will share manufacturing responsibilities with AbbVie being the primary manufacturer for global supply. The collaboration will accelerate I-Mab’s establishment of commercial production operations in China.

Financial Terms
Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will pay I-Mab $180 million in an upfront payment to exclusively license lemzoparlimab, along with $20 million in a milestone payment based on the Phase 1 results, for a total of $200 million. In addition, I-Mab will be eligible to receive up to $1.74 billion in success-based milestone payments for lemzoparlimab, of which $840 million are based on clinical development and regulatory approval milestones, with the remainder based on commercial milestones. Upon commercialization of lemzoparlimab, AbbVie will also pay tiered royalties from low-to-mid teen percentages on global net sales outside of greater China.

About CD47 and Lemzoparlimab
CD47 is a cell surface protein over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers and can act to protect tumors by delivering a “don’t eat me” signal to otherwise tumor-engulfing macrophages.  CD47 antibody blocks this signal and enables macrophages to attack tumor cells, making it a potentially promising cancer drug. However, development of CD47 antibody as a cancer therapy is hampered by its hematologic side effects, such as severe anemia, caused by natural binding of CD47 antibody to red blood cells. In a scientific breakthrough, scientists at I-Mab have discovered a unique CD47 antibody, lemzoparlimab, that works efficiently to target tumor cells while exerting a minimal untoward effect on red blood cells to avoid severe anemia.

Lemzoparlimab’s hematologic safety advantage and superb anti-tumor activities have been demonstrated previously in a series of robust pre-clinical studies. Today, the results of phase 1 clinical trial provide further clinical validation of this differentiation in patients with cancer. I-Mab continues to advance a combination study of lemzoparlimab with Keytruda® for solid tumor and with Rituxan® for lymphoma in US, in addition to an on-going clinical trial in patients with AML in China.

About CRC
CRC is cancer that starts in either the colon or rectum.  CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide, causing more than 860,000 deaths in 2018.[1]  In the U.S., it is estimated that 150,000 people will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,000 people will die from CRC in 2020.[2]  In Europe, CRC is the second most common cancer, with an estimated 490,000 new cases and 240,000 deaths in 2018.[3]  In Japan, CRC is the most common cancer, with an estimated 150,000 new cases and 57,000 deaths in 2018.[4]

 

About Fruquintinib
Fruquintinib is a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”) 1/2/3.  VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in blocking tumor angiogenesis.  Fruquintinib was designed to improve kinase selectivity to minimize off-target toxicities, improve tolerability and provide more consistent target coverage.  The generally good tolerability in patients to date, along with fruquintinib’s low potential for drug-drug interaction based on preclinical assessment, suggests that it may also be highly suitable for combinations with other anti-cancer therapies.

Chi-Med retains all rights to fruquintinib outside of China and is partnered with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) in China.

 

About Fruquintinib in metastatic CRC
Fruquintinib was approved for marketing by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in September 2018 and commercially launched by Lilly in late November 2018 under the brand name Elunate®.  Elunate® is for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC that have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, including those who have previously received anti-VEGF therapy and/or anti-EGFR therapy (RAS wild type).  Results of the FRESCO study, a Phase III pivotal registration trial of fruquintinib in 416 patients with metastatic CRC in China, were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, in June 2018 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02314819).

In December 2017, Chi-Med initiated a multi-center, open-label, Phase I/Ib clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of fruquintinib in U.S. patients with advanced solid tumors (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03251378). Proof-of-concept cohorts in patients with metastatic CRC and metastatic breast cancer were added in 2019.

 

Other Fruquintinib Development
Gastric Cancer in China: In October 2017, Chi-Med initiated the FRUTIGA study, a randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with paclitaxel for second-line treatment of advanced gastric or esophagogastric junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.  The trial is designed to enroll patients who did not respond to first-line standard chemotherapy.  Subjects will receive either fruquintinib combined with paclitaxel or placebo combined with paclitaxel.  Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to factors such as stomach vs. GEJ tumor type and performance status.  The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival.  Secondary efficacy endpoints include progression-free survival (as defined by RECIST 1.1), objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and quality-of-life score (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0).  Biomarkers related to the antitumor activity of fruquintinib will also be explored (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03223376).  In June 2020, Chi-Med completed a planned interim data review.  Based on the preset criteria, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended that the trial continue.

Immunotherapy combinations: Chi-Med has entered into three collaboration agreements to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fruquintinib in combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies, including with tislelizumab (BGB-A317, developed by BeiGene, Ltd.), Tyvyt® (sintilimab, IBI308, developed by Innovent Biologics, Inc.) and geptanolimab (GB226, developed by Genor Biopharma Co. Ltd.).

If approved, Yescarta would become the first CAR T cell therapy for this indication","— If Approved, Yescarta would be the First CAR T Therapy for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal Zone Lymphoma —

SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced that it has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma after two or more prior lines of systemic therapy. Yescarta was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for these indications. If approved, Yescarta would become the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

The sBLA submission is supported by data from the primary analysis of the Phase 2 ZUMA-5 trial, which is being submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific congress. Findings from an interim analysis of ZUMA-5 were recently presented during an oral session at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

“People living with indolent NHL often experience a disease that starts out slowly but becomes more aggressive over time with each subsequent relapse,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Kite’s Global Head of Clinical Development. “The efficacy observed in ZUMA-5 may provide a potentially transformative treatment option for higher-risk patients with certain types of indolent NHL. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to progress this application with the goal of bringing Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL as soon as possible.”

Yescarta was the first CAR T cell therapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from FL. Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. The Yescarta U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities, and Yescarta is approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

Yescarta has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Its safety and efficacy have not been established in these lymphomas.

About Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

Follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma are both forms of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in which malignant tumors slowly grow but can become more aggressive over time.

Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of indolent lymphoma and the second most common type of lymphoma globally. It accounts for approximately 22 percent of all lymphomas diagnosed worldwide. Marginal zone lymphoma is the third most common lymphoma, accounting for 8 to 12 percent of all B-cell NHLs.

Despite advances in management and substantial improvements in long-term survival, patients living with follicular lymphoma have varied outcomes. Currently, there are no standard of care treatments for relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy, and there are limited options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma.

About ZUMA-5

ZUMA-5 is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study that aims to enroll up to 160 adult patients (≥18 years old) with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL of either follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma subtypes, who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody combined with an alkylating agent. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of Yescarta in this patient population. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints include complete response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and CAR T cell and cytokines levels. The study is ongoing.

About Yescarta

Yescarta is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.

Limitation of Use : Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.

U.S. Important Safety Information for Yescarta

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta. Do not administer Yescarta to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.
Neurologic toxicities, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Yescarta, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Yescarta. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.
Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.
CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) occurred in 94% of patients, with 13% ≥ Grade 3. Among patients who died after receiving Yescarta, 4 had ongoing CRS at death. The median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days). Key manifestations include fever (78%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (28%), hypoxia (22%), and chills (20%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES occurred in 87% of patients, 98% of which occurred within the first 8 weeks with a median time to onset of 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and a median duration of 17 days. Grade ≥3 occurred in 31% of patients. The most common neurologic toxicities included encephalopathy (57%), headache (44%), tremor (31%), dizziness (21%), aphasia (18%), delirium (17%), insomnia (9%), and anxiety (9%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events including leukoencephalopathy and seizures, as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema have occurred. Following Yescarta infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter, and treat promptly.

REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site, immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).

HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Allergic reactions, including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 38% of patients. Grade ≥3 infections occurred in 23% of patients; those due to an unspecified pathogen occurred in 16% of patients, bacterial infections in 9%, and viral infections in 4%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 36% of patients and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade ≥3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 28% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (3%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 15% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.

SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common (incidence ≥20%) include CRS, fever, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, chills, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, infections-pathogen unspecified, nausea, hypoxia, tremor, cough, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmias.

47947,Genentech' Gavreto (pralsetinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval Metastatic RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Roche announces FDA approval of Gavreto (pralsetinib) for the treatment of adults with metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer,"The approval is based on P-I/II ARROW study assessing Gavreto (400mg, qd) in RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients with or without prior therapy, and regardless of RET fusion partner or CNS involvement. The study also involves patients with RET-MTC, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, and other RET-altered solid tumors
 Results: ORR (57%) and CR rate (5.7%) in 87 NSCLC patients prior treated with Pt. based CT, m-DOR was not reached, in 27 treatment-naïve NSCLC patients, ORR (70%); CR rate (11%). Gavreto is now the 6th FDA-approved medicine in Genentech’s portfolio for lung cancer and will co-commercialize by Genentech and Blueprint Medicines in the US
 Gavreto is an oral precision therapy targeting RET alterations, including fusions and mutations, regardless of the tissue of origin. Additionally, the US FDA has granted BT designation for RET fusion+ NSCLC and RET mutation+ MTC and PR designation for advanced or m-RET-mutant MTC and RET fusion+ thyroid cancer to the therapy with its anticipated PDUFA date as 28 Feb, 2021","Gavreto is a once-daily, oral precision therapy that selectively inhibits RET-altered cancers
Genentech and Blueprint Medicines will co-commercialise Gavreto in the United States
FDA also granted Priority Review to Gavreto for the treatment of people with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer
 
Basel, 7 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Gavreto™ (pralsetinib) for the treatment of adults with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA approved test. This indication was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval programme, based on data from the phase I/II ARROW study. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Gavreto is a once-daily, oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations. It is jointly commercialised by Genentech, a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, and Blueprint Medicines in the US and will be commercialised by Roche outside of the US, excluding Greater China*.

“The FDA approval of Gavreto for RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer is an important step towards our goal of providing an effective treatment option for every person diagnosed with lung cancer, no matter how rare or hard-to-treat their type of disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We remain committed to finding personalised treatment options for people with cancer based on specific genomic or molecular alterations, and we look forward to partnering with Blueprint Medicines to further explore the potential of Gavreto across multiple RET-altered tumour types.”

RET-activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and treatment options that selectively target these genetic alterations are limited. In NSCLC, RET fusions represent approximately 1-2% of patients.1 Biomarker testing for these fusions is the most effective way to identify people who are eligible for treatment with Gavreto.

The approval is based on the results from the phase I/II ARROW study, in which Gavreto produced durable clinical responses in people with RET fusion-positive NSCLC with or without prior therapy, and regardless of RET fusion partner or central nervous system involvement.2 Gavreto demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 57% (95% CI: 46%, 68%) and complete response (CR) rate of 5.7% in the 87 people with NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, and the median duration of response (DoR) was not reached (95% CI: 15.2 months, not reached).2 In the 27 people with treatment-naïve NSCLC, the ORR was 70% (95% CI: 50%, 86%), with an 11% CR rate.2 The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were fatigue, constipation, musculoskeletal pain and increased blood pressure (hypertension).2

Gavreto is now the sixth FDA-approved medicine in Roche’s portfolio of treatments for lung cancer. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Gavreto for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC that has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and for RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.

The FDA has also granted Priority Review to Gavreto for the treatment of people with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, and is expected to make a decision on approval by 28 February 2021. This New Drug Application (NDA) was accepted for review under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.

About the ARROW study3
ARROW (NCT03037385) is a phase I/II, open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Gavreto, administered orally in people with rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer and other RET-altered solid tumours. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion, which is complete, and an expansion portion in people treated with 400 mg of Gavreto, once-daily. ARROW is being conducted at multiple sites across the United States, European Union and Asia.

About Gavreto
Gavreto is a once-daily, oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations, regardless of the tissue of origin. Preclinical data have shown that Gavreto inhibits primary RET fusions and mutations that cause cancer in subsets of patients, as well as secondary RET mutations predicted to drive resistance to treatment. Blueprint Medicines and Roche are also co-developing Gavreto for the treatment of patients with various types of RET-altered thyroid cancers and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca to present 60 abstracts from inhaled and biologics
portfolio and pipeline at the ERS Congress

A post-hoc analysis of the Phase III ETHOS trial showed a consistent benefit of Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) in reducing the rate of moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations across all seasons compared with Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) in patients with moderate to very severe disease.1

These data are among 60 AstraZeneca abstracts accepted for presentation, including 10 oral presentations, at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Virtual Congress 2020, between 7-9 September.

Gary Ferguson, Clinical Professor of Medicine at Michigan State University, Director of the Pulmonary Research Institute of Southeast Michigan, Farmington Hills, Michigan, US and Investigator in the ETHOS trial, said: “Treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can be challenging in the winter as they experience more frequent and more severe exacerbations, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Results from the ETHOS trial should give clinicians confidence that they can reduce moderate or severe exacerbations, even during winter when respiratory diseases can put additional strain on healthcare systems.”

Ruud Dobber, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit, said: “These additional data from the Phase III ETHOS trial are important in supporting clinicians’ understanding of the robust clinical profile of Breztri Aerosphere, which has been approved in the US, China and Japan and is under regulatory review in the EU. With 60 company abstracts accepted for presentation at ERS, there is a wealth of data across AstraZeneca’s inhaled combinations and biologic medicines, which demonstrates our commitment to advancing clinical practice in respiratory disease.”

AstraZeneca abstracts to be presented at the ERS International Congress 2020 include:

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.2 It affects an estimated 384 million people3 and is the third leading cause of death globally.4 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.2 A single COPD exacerbation can have a negative impact on lung function5, quality of life6 and increase the risk of hospitalisation.7 Additionally, even one COPD exacerbation that results in hospitalisation, increases the risk of death.8,9

Patients with COPD experience an increase in incidence of exacerbations and severe exacerbations during the winter.10,11 Studies have also shown higher rates of COPD hospital admissions and more respiratory-related deaths in winter compared with summer months.10-13 

ETHOS

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.14

Breztri Aerosphere

Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) is a single-inhaler, fixed dose triple-combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with glycopyrrolate, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), delivered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Building on a 50-year heritage, AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, across inhaled and biologic medicines. AstraZeneca aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by eliminating preventable asthma attacks across all severities and removing COPD as a leading cause of death through earlier biology-led treatment. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential in rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in immunology is to achieve disease control and ultimately clinical remission in targeted immune-driven diseases.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology.

Alkahest currently has four candidates in six phase-2 clinical trials covering therapeutic products for neurodegenerative, cognitive decline, neuromuscular and ophthalmic indications
Alkahest has developed a map of the human plasma proteome facilitating the identification of plasma proteins and their recombinant analogues as potential therapeutic medicines
Barcelona, Spain, and San Carlos, Calif., September 7, 2020 – Grifols (MCE: GRF, MCE: GRF.P, NASDAQ: GRFS), a leading global producer of plasma-derived medicines and a leader in the development of innovative diagnostic solutions, today announced it has entered into a transaction to acquire the remaining equity of Alkahest, Inc. in exchange for a total price of $146 million, on a debt-free basis. No additional financing will be required.

The closing of the transaction is subject to the approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, and is expected to close in early 2021.

The Silicon Valley-based biotechnology company was founded upon research into the therapeutic use of plasma proteins in combating diseases associated with aging as identified in the Stanford University laboratory of Tony Wyss-Coray, professor of Neurology at Stanford and co-founder and board member of Alkahest.

In addition to the clinical development of specific plasma fractions and protein inhibitors, Alkahest is focused on developing a complete understanding of the human plasma proteome. This unique proteomic platform of targets will help Grifols and Alkahest to unlock new therapeutics and diagnostics, develop new plasma proteins, new indications for currently licensed plasma proteins, biomarkers for diagnostics, recombinant proteins and antibodies as well as small-molecule drugs.

Understanding the plasma proteome is the key to Alkahest’s comprehensive discovery and development platform delivering transformational therapeutics. Alkahest, as a wholly owned subsidiary within the Grifols innovation office (GIANT), will focus on proteins with biological impact that change with age. Thus far, more than 8,000 separate proteins have been identified by Alkahest and using advanced techniques of molecular analysis at the cellular level, an array of new products are expected to enter Grifols’ discovery and development pipeline and bring new therapeutic medicines to market.

“We saw the promise of Alkahest’s understanding of aging when we made our first investment and entered into a collaboration agreement with them five years ago,” said Víctor Grífols, co-CEO of Grifols. “Now we see a wealth of plasma-derived and non-plasma therapeutic candidates identified by Alkahest that can significantly support the unmet needs of many diseases associated with aging.”

Karoly Nikolich, CEO of Alkahest, said, “We are excited to join forces with Grifols, an industry leader in plasma-derived medicines, to realize our shared vision and mission of delivering innovative medicines for age-related diseases on an ambitious scale.”

Dr. Wyss-Coray added: “It is most gratifying to see some of our initial academic discoveries on the therapeutic power of plasma proteins being translated into new treatments for human diseases through the synergies between Grifols and Alkahest. I am thrilled to continue and expand our productive partnership and am optimistic for continued clinical success.”

47986,Boehringer Ingelheim and Pharmaxis Halt the Development of BI 1467335 for Diabetic Retinopathy,Boehringer Ingelheim discontinues development of BI 1467335 for Diabetic Retinopathy,"The companies discontinue the P-IIa study assessing BI 1467335 vs PBO in 79 patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR without CIDME for 12wks. treatment period with an additional 12wks. follow-up period afterward. The study met its 1EPs in ocular safety with the treatment being well-tolerated
 The discontinuation is due to a lack of a clear efficacy signal and risk of dose-dependent drug interactions of the compound in NPDR patients identified in another P-I study. Additionally, Boehringer Ingelheim has terminated its 2015 agreement with Pharmaxis with 90 days notice period
 Boehringer Ingelheim will deploy its expertise in multiple therapeutic areas and will advance its portfolio of next-generation retinal therapy approaches while Pharmaxis will continue its development of amine oxidase inhibitors with a P-II study in myelofibrosis, commencing later this year","BI 1467335 was acquired from Pharmaxis in 2015 as part of Boehringer Ingelheim’s growing Retinal Health R&D pipeline portfolio
Boehringer Ingelheim has terminated the agreement with Pharmaxis with 90 days’ notice during which time Pharmaxis can request return of all existing data and intellectual property.
Boehringer Ingelheim will continue to advance its comprehensive portfolio of next generation retinal therapy approaches
Pharmaxis will continue its development of small molecule amine oxidase inhibitors with a phase 2 study in myelofibrosis due to commence later this year
Ingelheim, Germany and Sydney, Australia, 7 September 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim and Pharmaxis Ltd today announced the discontinuation of the development of anti-inflammatory AOC3 inhibitor BI 1467335 for the treatment of patients with moderate-severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). BI 1467335 was acquired from Pharmaxis in 2015 and Boehringer Ingelheim will now terminate the agreement.
In a Phase IIa trial in patients with moderate-severe NPDR, BI 1467335 met its primary endpoint in ocular safety with the treatment being well tolerated. Boehringer Ingelheim decided not to further develop BI 1467335 in this indication based on the lack of a clear efficacy signal and risk of dose dependent drug interactions of the compound in NPDR patients identified in another Phase I study.
Boehringer Ingelheim takes a holistic approach to the development of novel retinal disease therapies, targeting key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases. By leveraging existing expertise in oncology, inflammation, neurodegeneration, fibrosis and cardiometabolic diseases, the company is building a growing portfolio of next generation retinal therapy approaches in various stages of development up to Phase 2 in macular degeneration and diabetic retinal diseases.
Pharmaxis CEO, Gary Phillips said, “We understand Boehringer Ingelheim’s decision to stop development of BI 1467335 in NPDR based on the risk of dose dependent drug interactions at the dose level that was tested in the Phase IIa trial. Based on recent publications AOC3 remains an important clinical target. We will review the data collected in more detail to evaluate potential opportunities in other indications that already have supportive pre-clinical data and where the risk of drug interactions are of less concern. In the meantime, we look forward to the upcoming FDA decision on granting a marketing authorisation for Bronchitol in the US cystic fibrosis market and our focus remains on advancing our anti-cancer pan-LOX inhibitor program into a phase 2 myelofibrosis study following the recent IND approval.”
About the Phase IIa trial with BI 1467335 in NPDR (ROBIN study)
The Phase IIa trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03238963) was a Phase IIa multi-centre, double-masked design in 79 patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without center-involved diabetic macular edema (CIDME). The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BI 1467335. Secondary objective was the proportion of patients with a two step improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS). Patients were randomized to either BI 1467335 or to placebo for a 12-week treatment period with an additional 12-week follow-up period afterwards.
About Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision-loss in adults aged 20-74. It progresses from mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy to moderate and severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), characterized by retinal hemorrhages and vascular changes in the retina, to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), characterized by the growth of new blood vessels on the retina. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), characterized by retinal thickening from leaky blood vessels, can develop at all stages of retinopathy. Of an estimated 285 million people with diabetes mellitus worldwide, approximately one third have signs of DR and of these, a further one third of DR is vision-threatening DR (severe NPDR, PDR and DME).

The portfolio consists of well-established injectable anticoagulants sold in Europe under the brand names, and variations of the brand names, Arixtra, Fraxiparine, Mono-Embolex and Orgaran. These products had combined net sales of approximately EUR 231 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 and are expected to be accretive to Mylan’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins, as well as the anticipated consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins of Viatris.

Mylan President Rajiv Malik commented: “The acquisition of this thrombosis portfolio is a significant addition to Mylan’s European business that will not only make Mylan the second largest supplier of these products to patients in Europe, according to IQVIA, but also bolster our existing commercial infrastructure to further expand access to complex injectables. By adding to our highly experienced sales and marketing team, we will further strengthen our current reach in hospitals and enhance the future growth of our biosimilars franchise in Europe.”

Mylan Executive Chairman Robert J. Coury commented: “As we continue toward the launch of  Viatris, we remain committed to executing on opportunities that will not only add to Mylan’s growth, but that also will be consistent with our vision for Viatris under the Global Healthcare Gateway™, which we believe will establish the new company as a true Partner of Choice™.”

Aspen will retain manufacturing and product supply responsibilities and will supply Mylan with finished product. Aspen has a fully vertically integrated supply chain predominantly located in Europe.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins, are presented in order to supplement investors’ and other readers’ understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Mylan N.V. (“Mylan” or the “Company”). Mylan is not providing forward-looking information for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, including integration, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, including changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the relevant period. The forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, Viatris ≤ 2.5x sustained leverage target, is based on the ratio of (i) targeted long-term average debt, and (ii) targeted long-term Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA. However, the Company has not quantified future amounts to develop the target but has stated its goal to manage long-term average debt and adjusted earnings and EBITDA over time in order to generally maintain the target. This target does not reflect Company guidance. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Mylan’s Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA was based on the sum of (i) Mylan’s adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and (ii) certain adjustments permitted to be included in Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2020 pursuant to the revolving credit facility dated as of July 27, 2018 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), among Mylan Inc., as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, certain affiliates and subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto as guarantors, each lender from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”). For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Mylan calculated adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) adjusted for clean energy investments pre-tax loss, income tax (benefit) provision, interest expense and depreciation and amortization (to get to EBITDA) and further adjusted for share-based compensation expense, litigation settlements and other contingencies, net and restructuring, acquisition related and other special items to get to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues. Historical Mylan non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to future non-GAAP financial measures that may be used by the combined company. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

48005,Sanofi Reports Results of Dupixent (dupilumab) in P-III LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSE OLE Study for Asthma,Dupixent (dupilumab) long-term data show sustained improvement in lung function and reduction in severe exacerbations in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma,"The P-III OLE study involves assessing of Dupixent (300mg) + SOC in 2,282 adults/ adolescents with mod.-to-sev. asthma prior participated in a controlled Dupixent clinical trial, including the pivotal P-IIb DRI (24wks.) and P-III QUEST (52wks.) trials in patients with mod.-to-sev. asthma and the P-III VENTURE (24wks.) trial in patients with severe OCS-dependent asthma
 The P-III OLE study results demonstrated the safety & efficacy profile observed in previous Dupixent trials were maintained for up to 3yrs. i.e, improvement in lung function by 13-22% @96wks., patients maintained a low rate of severe asthma attacks, AE rates (76-88%) and will be presented at 2020 ERS International Congress
 Dupixent is a mAb inhibiting the signaling of the IL-4 & IL-13 proteins and is the only biologic to demonstrate sustained improvements in lung function and asthma exacerbations across a broad patient population with type 2 inflammation","With more than 2,200 patients enrolled, Phase 3 open-label extension trial is the largest of a biologic medicine ever conducted in asthma
Data up to three years show a safety profile consistent with pivotal asthma trials
Dupixent is the only biologic to demonstrate sustained improvements in lung function and asthma exacerbations across a broad patient population with type 2 inflammation
Data to be presented at the 2020 ERS International Congress
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, NY – September 8, 2020 – New results from a Dupixent® (dupilumab) Phase 3 open-label extension trial showed that the safety and efficacy profile observed in previous Dupixent trials were maintained for up to three years in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma. Data from the trial will be presented during a live session at the virtual 2020 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress.

“These data suggest Dupixent may slow the progressive decline in lung function that many patients with moderate-to-severe asthma experience, as shown by the sustained improvement in lung function for up to three years. Further, patients on Dupixent maintained asthma control and reduced rates of severe asthma attacks that may result in hospitalizations,” said Michael Wechsler, M.D., M.M.Sc., Director of the National Jewish Cohen Family Asthma Institute in Denver, Colorado, and principal investigator of the trial. “This reinforces the importance of Dupixent as a continuous, long-term treatment option to improve patients’ ability to breathe and maintain control of their asthma, particularly in those with higher markers of underlying type 2 inflammation.”

The analyses to be presented at ERS include more than 2,200 patients who previously participated in Dupixent asthma trials, including three pivotal trials that lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Patients entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the initial trials and were treated for up to an additional two years, providing up to three years of treatment data in total. The safety analyses included patients from all three pivotal asthma trials and the efficacy and biomarker analyses included patients who are not dependent on oral corticosteroids (OCS) from the pivotal Phase 2b and Phase 3 QUEST trials. Additional long-term efficacy data in OCS-dependent patients will be presented at a later congress. Results showed:

Efficacy:

Lung function: Patients continued to experience improvement in lung function by 13-22% at 96 weeks, as measured by the average change in forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) compared to baseline for the initial asthma trials.
Asthma attacks: Patients maintained a low rate of severe asthma attacks (unadjusted annualized severe exacerbation rate) with an average of 0.31-0.35 events per year. In the year prior to commencing Dupixent trials, the rate of severe asthma attacks was 2.09-2.17 events per year.
Type 2 inflammation: Improvements in lung function and asthma attacks were greater in those with elevated baseline blood eosinophils or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which are markers of type 2 inflammation. In these long-term results, patients showed reductions in blood eosinophils (23-35%) and in blood IgE for patients from the pivotal Phase 2b trial (82%) compared to baseline for the initial asthma trials.
Safety:
·The proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs) in the open-label extension trial was similar to that seen in prior pivotal trials of Dupixent in asthma. Over the 96-week treatment period, overall AE rates were 76-88% and the most common AEs were nasopharyngitis (18-26%) and injection-site erythema (2-23%). Overall serious AEs were experienced by 9-13% of patients.

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and atopic dermatitis. Across all approved indications globally, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent.

About the LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSE OLE Trial

The Phase 3, multicenter, open-label extension trial evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent treatment in 2,282 adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in a controlled Dupixent clinical trial, including the pivotal Phase 2b DRI (24 weeks) and Phase 3 QUEST (52 weeks) trials in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and the Phase 3 VENTURE (24 weeks) trial in patients with severe oral corticosteroid (OCS)-dependent asthma. Patients in the open-label extension trial received 300 mg Dupixent every other week for up to 96 weeks in addition to standard-of-care maintenance therapies. The primary endpoints were the number and proportion of patients experiencing any AEs up to 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included mean change in FEV1 and annualized severe exacerbation rate. Type 2 inflammation was defined as raised FeNO (≥ 25 ppb) or blood eosinophils (≥150 cells/μL) at initial trial baseline. Data at ERS are presented as a range of mean values for those treated with placebo and Dupixent in each of the initial pivotal trials.

About Dupixent
Dupixent is approved in the EU for adults and adolescents 12 years and older as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO, who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.  In the U.S., Dupixent is approved for use with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in patients aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. Dupixent is also approved for use in certain patients with asthma in Japan and other countries around the world.

Dupixent is approved for additional uses in certain patients with atopic dermatitis and CRSwNP in the EU, U.S., and Japan, as well as other countries around the world. In adolescents 12 years of age or older, it is recommended that Dupixent be administered by or under the supervision of an adult. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver.

Dupilumab Development Program

To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by allergic and other type 2 inflammation, including pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

 It has received FDA’s BDD for improved treatment/diagnosis of life-threatening diseases for transplant patients. The approval allows Roche to offer HCPs a transplant testing portfolio that includes Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus to monitor and improve care for transplant patients
 The cobas BKV Test is a fully automated PCR viral load test that runs on cobas 6800/8800 Systems and has a robust coverage with a detection limit (21.5 IU/mL) and an expanded linear range (21.5 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL) in EDTA plasma","Immunocompromised transplant patients are at risk of major complications when infected with BK virus
cobas BKV test addresses critical need for hospitals and laboratories to have standardised and comparable results across institutions
New Breakthrough Device test expands Roche molecular test menu for transplant patients, enabling simultaneous testing of BK virus with Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus
Basel, 8 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510k clearance for the cobas® BKV Test on the cobas® 6800 and 8800 Systems. The test was previously granted FDA Breakthrough Device designation demonstrating the improved treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening diseases or conditions for transplant patients. The test provides standardised, high-quality results that can help healthcare professionals better assess the risk of complications caused by the BK virus in transplant patients and identify effective treatment options.

BK virus (BKV) is a member of the polyomavirus family that can cause severe transplant-associated complications. Infection can occur without symptoms and happen early in life. After primary infection, the virus can remain inactive, only to possibly reactivate in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients.

“Our diagnostic tests can help clinicians greatly improve patient treatment plans and make quick adjustments for personalised healthcare,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This FDA clearance allows Roche to offer healthcare professionals a transplant testing portfolio that includes Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and BK virus so they can simultaneously monitor and improve care for transplant patients who are at risk for these common infections or viral reactivations which can cause further illness or death.”

The cobas BKV Test is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral load test that runs on the fully automated and widely available cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems. Along with the previously approved cobas® EBV and CMV Tests, the cobas BKV Test has been calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard. This means that test results are reported in international units, making it possible for laboratories anywhere in the U.S. to obtain comparable results when measuring levels of BKV DNA.

About the cobas BKV Test
The cobas BKV Test was previously granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA, together with the cobas EBV Test.

The cobas BKV Test is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with dual-target technology that provides quantitative accuracy and guards against the risk of sequence variations that may be present in the BK virus. The cobas BKV Test has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 21.5 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 21.5 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma.

The test offers an alternative to lab-developed tests (LDTs) or Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) combinations, potentially minimising variability and complexity in testing, reducing workload and alleviating risk for laboratories. The test supports the goal of result standardisation across institutions by providing reproducible, high-quality results for clinical decision-making.

The fully automated cobas BKV Test and the cobas CMV and cobas EBV Tests can run on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems simultaneously, providing absolute automation with proven performance and flexibility, leading to time savings and increased efficiency.

About BK polyomavirus
BK polyomavirus (BKV) is a member of the polyomavirus family that can cause transplant-associated complications including nephropathy in kidney transplantation and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Infection can occur early in life, often with no symptoms. After primary infection, the virus can remain inactive throughout life, only to possibly reactivate in immunocompromised individuals, such as patients who receive solid-organ transplants. For kidney transplant patients, BKV infection is considered the most common viral complication, causing polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) in up to 10 percent of kidney transplant recipients, and about 50 percent of PVN-affected patients will experience transplant graft failure.1  BKV is also associated with hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.2

8 September 2020

LONDON, Silence Therapeutics plc, AIM:SLN and NASDAQ: SLN (“Silence” or “the Company”) a leader in the discovery, development and delivery of novel short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need, today provides a research and development update.

Pipeline progress

SLN360

· Silence’s wholly owned lead product candidate SLN360 for the treatment of cardiovascular disease associated with high Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), levels, has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to start dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers and secondary prevention patients with elevated Lp(a). SLN360 is designed to address increased cardiovascular risk associated with raised levels of Lp(a), which is considered to affect up to 10% of the world’s population. Whilst we are aiming to start dosing healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 trial by the end of the year, the Covid-19 pandemic may put this timing at risk.

SLN124

· Silence has initiated dosing in its randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 single-ascending dose study of SLN124, the Company’s wholly owned product candidate for beta-thalassaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in up to 24 healthy volunteers. This marks the first dose of a Silence siRNA therapeutic delivered to humans using the Company’s proprietary GalNAc-siRNA platform. GalNAc is a naturally occurring sugar that binds specifically to a receptor which is highly expressed on liver cells, or hepatocytes. Coupling GalNAc sugars to stabilized siRNA molecules allows them to specifically target liver cells and carry out their function.

· The FDA recently granted SLN124 orphan drug designation (ODD) for the treatment of adult beta-thalassemia. The FDA previously granted SLN124 ODD for MDS and rare paediatric designation for beta-thalassaemia. SLN124 also has ODD for the treatment of beta-thalassaemia from the European Medical Agency.

Complement Collaboration

· Silence is pleased to announce work commenced on the second target being explored under its complement pathway RNAi collaboration with Mallinckrodt, which triggered a $2.0 million research milestone payment to the Company. Silence would be entitled to receive an additional $2.0 million research milestone payment if work commences on a third target in the collaboration.

Iain Ross, Executive Chairman of Silence Therapeutics, said: “In what has been a busy and successful year for Silence, we have continued to make significant progress with our R&D pipeline. We are delighted to announce today that we have received FDA approval of the IND application for our wholly owned lead product candidate, SLN360, which is designed to address a significant unmet medical need in cardiovascular disease for people born with high Lp(a) levels . We have also made strong progress with our wholly owned product candidate, SLN124, having now dosed the first healthy volunteer. This marks the first dose of a Silence GalNAc-siRNA given to humans and is the culmination of several years’ work in developing this platform. This is truly an exciting time for Silence and we look forward to providing further updates as we move ahead.”

 Results: @median follow-up of 37 mos. IR treated patients lived longer without disease progression with a PFS (88 %), compared to 75 % for FCR treated patients. The study also showed an OS advantage for the IR regimen
 Ibrutinib (oral, qd) is a first-in-class BTK inhibitor that blocks the BTK protein and helps abnormal B cells movement out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs. Ibrutinib is approved for CLL, MCL, and WM in Europe and in 99+ countries for at least one indication","Patients who were new to CLL treatment lived longer without disease progression with the IMBRUVICA®-based regimen compared to patients treated with a chemo-immunotherapy regimen1

September 07, 2020 04:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BEERSE, Belgium–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved a variation to the marketing authorisation for IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), extending the approved indication in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to include combination with rituximab for previously untreated adult patients. The decision is based on data from the Phase 3 E1912 study that showed previously untreated patients aged 70 years or younger treated with ibrutinib plus rituximab lived longer without disease progression than those treated with the established chemo-immunotherapy regimen fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR).2,3 The study was designed and conducted in the United States (U.S.) by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.2,3

“Historically, chemotherapy with FCR has been the standard of care, or first treatment prescribed for patients with previously untreated CLL”

The study evaluated 529 previously untreated patients with CLL aged 70 years or younger (median age, 58 years) who were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of ibrutinib plus rituximab (IR) (n=354), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or six cycles of FCR (n=175).2

At a median follow-up of 37 months, patients treated with IR lived longer without disease progression, with a progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 88 percent, compared to 75 percent for patients treated with FCR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.52; p<0.0001).1 The study also showed an overall survival (OS) advantage for patients treated with the IR regimen.1 The primary study results were published previously in The New England Journal of Medicine, and with extended 48-month follow-up, as presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, the initial treatment benefit is maintained.2,3

“Historically, chemotherapy with FCR has been the standard of care, or first treatment prescribed for patients with previously untreated CLL,” said John Gribben, MD DSc, Professor of Medical Oncology at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London. “This decision by the EC is an important step in being able to offer patients with CLL a non-chemotherapy option in the frontline setting, building on the established efficacy and safety we have come to expect from ibrutinib-based therapy.”

“We are delighted with the EC’s decision approving the use of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab for these patients,” said Dr Patrick Laroche, Haematology Therapy Area Lead, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag. “This new non-chemotherapy combination regimen can offer extended remission, as well as fewer chemotherapy-related side effects for patients living with CLL.”

Adverse events for the IR arm were consistent with the known safety profiles for ibrutinib and rituximab.1 The most common adverse reactions seen with ibrutinib include diarrhoea, neutropaenia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, haemorrhage (e.g., bruising), thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, arthralgia, and upper respiratory tract infection.4 The most common serious adverse reactions (which may affect more than 1 in 20 people) include neutropenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, and hypertension.4

“Ibrutinib is the most comprehensively studied Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor with the longest follow-up across eight positive Phase 3 trials in CLL to date, and is recognised as an important advancement in treatment for patients with CLL,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “This latest milestone highlights our commitment to studying the full potential of ibrutinib and in developing regimens which can transform what a CLL diagnosis means for patients going forward.”

This announcement comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of this expanded indication for ibrutinib in April 2020.

About ibrutinib
Ibrutinib is a once-a-day, first-in-class Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is administered orally.4 Ibrutinib blocks the BTK protein; the BTK protein sends important signals that tell B cells to mature and produce antibodies. BTK signalling is needed by specific cancer cells to multiply and spread.5 By blocking BTK, ibrutinib may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.6

Indications for which ibrutinib is approved in Europe include:4

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): As a single agent or in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL, and as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM): As a single agent for the treatment of adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy, and in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients
Ibrutinib is approved in more than 99 countries for at least one indication, and to date, has been used to treat more than 200,000 patients worldwide.7

For a full list of side effects and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using ibrutinib please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for further information.

About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is typically a slow-growing blood cancer of the white blood cells.8 The overall incidence of CLL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year and is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women.9 CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a median age of 72 years at diagnosis.10

The disease eventually progresses in the majority of patients, and they are faced with fewer treatment options with each relapse. Patients are often prescribed multiple lines of therapy as they relapse or become resistant to treatments.

Phase IIIb clinical trial programme of higher-dose OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) to evaluate impact on reducing disability progression in RMS and PPMS
OCREVUS CHIMES study exclusively focused on disease insights and more tailored care for minority populations with MS 
Basel, 9 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the initiation of an innovative Phase III clinical trial programme for its investigational medicine fenebrutinib in multiple sclerosis (MS), along with a higher-dose Phase III clinical trial programme for OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) and a distinct OCREVUS trial specifically to support African-American and Hispanic- and Latinx-American patients with MS. Overviews of clinical trials and scientific rationale will be presented at MSVirtual2020, the 8th Joint Meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) from 11-13 September 2020.

“We remain committed to advancing the science in MS by investigating potential new medicines such as fenebrutinib, with the ultimate goal of halting progression of this disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “In addition, over 170,000 people have been treated with OCREVUS, our first-in-class B-cell therapy, and we are incorporating years of clinical trial data and real-world evidence to optimise its potential to improve outcomes for patients with MS.”

Fenebrutinib Phase III clinical trial programme
Roche is initiating a Phase III clinical trial programme for fenebrutinib, an investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor in relapsing MS (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Increasing evidence suggests that B cells and myeloid lineage cells contribute to disease progression in MS. Fenebrutinib is a dual inhibitor of both B-cell and myeloid lineage-cell activation, which may conceivably offer a novel approach to suppress disease activity and slow disease progression by targeting both acute and chronic inflammatory aspects of MS, which will be studied in the Phase III clinical trial programme.  Pre-clinical data have shown fenebrutinib is highly selective and acts as a non-covalent agent with a slow release rate from its target.

The Phase III clinical trial programme includes two identical Phase III trials in RMS (named FENhance 1 and FENhance 2) and one Phase III trial in PPMS (named FENtrepid). All three trials are targeting clinical disability progression and have a primary endpoint of 12-week composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP-12), with the addition of a co-primary endpoint of annualised relapse rate in the RMS trials. The PPMS study is the first study in this patient population to have an active comparator – OCREVUS – rather than placebo.

OCREVUS higher dose Phase IIIb clinical trial programme
Halting disease progression is the ultimate aim for patients and physicians, and we are acting on the needs of the MS community, informed by recent data, to optimise the potential of OCREVUS to slow progression for a broad range of patients. Roche is therefore initiating two new Phase IIIb trials, one in RMS (named MUSETTE) and one in PPMS (named GAVOTTE), which will evaluate a higher OCREVUS dose compared with the currently approved 600 mg dose, with both evaluated at the twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing schedule. This decision was based on analyses from the pivotal RMS and PPMS studies presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting 2019, which showed higher OCREVUS exposure was associated with lower B-cell levels and with greater control of disability progression, without impacting safety.

At the currently approved 600 mg dose, OCREVUS is the only MS treatment that has demonstrated a consistent and significant impact on slowing disability progression in both RMS and PPMS Phase III studies. The clinical trial programme will evaluate the potential benefit of higher dose OCREVUS in further reducing disability progression for people living with both RMS and PPMS.

OCREVUS CHIMES trial in minority patients
Roche recently initiated the Phase IV CHIMES (CHaracterization of ocrelizumab In Minorities with multiplE Sclerosis) trial in African-Americans and Hispanic- and Latinx-Americans with RMS. These patient populations are more likely to experience more relapses and greater disability than Caucasians, yet are vastly underrepresented in most clinical trials.

CHIMES is the first prospective trial developed in collaboration with MS patients, patient advocacy groups and investigators to exclusively focus on meeting the needs of minority patients with MS. The findings are expected to improve current understanding of MS disease biology and treatment response, among African-American and Hispanic- and Latinx-American patients with MS, with the ultimate goal of increasing high-quality standard of care to traditionally underserved communities and enhancing equality through clinical research.

All of the newly announced clinical trials are underway and anticipated to begin recruiting in the coming months.

About multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects nearly 1 million people in the U.S. and more than 2.3 million people worldwide. MS occurs when the immune system abnormally attacks the insulation and support around nerve cells (myelin sheath) in the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves), causing inflammation and consequent damage. This damage can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue and difficulty seeing, and may eventually lead to disability. Most people with MS experience their first symptom between 20 and 40 years of age, making the disease the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in younger adults.

People with all forms of MS experience disease progression – permanent loss of nerve cells in the central nervous system and gradual worsening of disability – at the beginning of their disease even if their clinical symptoms aren’t apparent or don’t appear to be getting worse. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can negatively impact people with MS, both in terms of their physical, mental and financial health. An important goal of treating MS is to slow the progression of disability as early as possible.

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease and is characterised by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. Approximately 85% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) include people with RRMS and people with SPMS who continue to experience relapses. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a debilitating form of the disease marked by steadily worsening symptoms but typically without distinct relapses or periods of remission. Approximately 15% of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form of the disease. Until the FDA approval of OCREVUS, there had been no FDA approved treatments for PPMS.

About fenebrutinib
Fenebrutinib is designed to be a highly selective small molecule and is the only reversible (non-covalent) BTK inhibitor currently in Phase III development in MS. Increasing evidence suggests that B cells and myeloid lineage cells contribute to disease progression in MS. Fenebrutinib is a dual inhibitor of both B-cell and myeloid lineage-cell activation, which may offer a novel approach to suppress disease activity and slow disease progression by targeting both acute and chronic inflammatory aspects of MS, which will be studied in our Phase III clinical trial programme. The safety profile of fenebrutinib has been studied in more than 1,200 people to date across several inflammatory diseases, and the data indicate that the high selectivity of fenebrutinib may limit off-target effects.

About OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab)
OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including clinically isolated syndrome, RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS, in addition to clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

48068,Takeda Divests its Select Non-Core Assets in the EU and Canada to Cheplapharm for $562M,Takeda Divests Select Non-Core Assets in Europe to Cheplapharm for Approximately $562 million USD,"Takeda will receive $562M up front for divesting its non-core prescription pharmaceutical products targeting a variety of therapeutic categories sold predominantly in the EU and Canada
 The divested portfolio includes Takeda’s CV/ metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic areas along with Calcium. The portfolio generated FY 2019 net sales of ~$260M
 The divestiture further enables Takeda’s EUCAN to focus on and drive strategic core growth areas. In Apr’2020, Takeda divested EUCAN’s non-core OTC products to Orifarm Group","– Divestiture strategy on track
– Portfolio includes prescription products in Takeda’s Cardiovascular/Metabolic and Anti-inflammatory therapeutic areas along with Calcium

Osaka, JAPAN, September 8, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest a portfolio of select non-core prescription pharmaceutical products sold predominantly in Europe and Canada to Cheplapharm. Cheplapharm is a specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Germany with a 25-year history of successfully acquiring, integrating and growing pharmaceutical products. Takeda will receive an upfront payment of approximately $562 million USD, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

The portfolio to be divested to Cheplapharm is comprised of non-core prescription pharmaceutical products in a variety of therapeutic categories sold predominantly in Europe and Canada. This includes Cardiovascular/Metabolic and Anti-Inflammatory products along with Calcium. The portfolio generated FY 2019 net sales of approximately $260 million USD. While the products included in the sale address key patient needs in these countries, they are outside of Takeda’s five key business areas. With a more focused portfolio, the divestiture further enables Takeda’s Europe & Canada Business Unit (EUCAN) to focus on and drive strategic core growth areas. In April 2020, Takeda announced to divest EUCAN’s non-core over-the-counter (OTC) products to Orifarm Group.

Giles Platford, President, EUCAN, Takeda, said, “These divestments represent another important milestone in our portfolio simplification and optimization strategy as we position Takeda for continued success across our five key business areas: Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience. We are pleased to have found a partner in Cheplapharm who shares our commitment to patient care and has the experience and resources to continue investing in these important products well into the future for the benefit of patients.”

Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda, said, “Today’s announcement allows Takeda to continue to be patient-focused as we streamline and optimize our portfolio according to our global long-term strategy. While the trusted products included in the sale address key patient needs in these countries, they are outside of our core business areas of focus. We are confident that Cheplapharm is the right partner to ensure patients continue to have access to these products.”

The sale of these non-core prescription products supports Takeda’s continued divestiture program. Last month, Takeda announced an agreement to divest Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company Limited to Blackstone for approximately $2.3 billion USD. In June, Takeda agreed to divest a portfolio of non-core assets sold exclusively in the Asia Pacific region to Celltrion for up to $278 million USD; in April, Takeda announced the sale of non-core OTC products in Europe to Orifarm Group for up to approximately $670 million USD, including the sale of two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland; and in March, Takeda announced the sale of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD, as well as completed the previously announced sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino.

Transaction Details
There are no anticipated employee transfers in connection with this transaction.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of Fiscal Year 2020 (ending March 2021), subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and receipt of required regulatory clearances. Until then, the products will continue to be made available to patients and manufactured and supplied by Takeda.

Takeda intends to use the proceeds from this transaction to reduce its debt and accelerate de-leveraging toward its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within Fiscal Year 2021 to 2023. Takeda is committed to rapid deleveraging driven by strong cash flow and divestiture proceeds, while also simplifying our portfolio.

Takeda is being advised by J.P. Morgan as our financial advisor and White & Case is our legal advisor in this transaction.

 Nerivio is a wireless remote electrical neuromodulation device for the acute treatment of migraine with/out aura in patients ≥18yrs. who do not have chronic migraine. The device is self-applied to the upper-arm and should be used in the home environment at the onset of migraine headache or aura","Theranica Announces Nerivio will be Available in Select European Countries Starting in 2021

MONTCLAIR, NJ. & NETANYA, Israel, Sept. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Theranica, a prescribed digital therapeutics company developing advanced electroceuticals for migraine and other pain conditions, today announced that it has been granted a CE mark for its Nerivio® device for acute treatment of migraine, a little more than a year after receiving FDA clearance in the United States.

This milestone allows the award-winning wearable therapeutic device to be marketed in select countries in Europe, as part of the company’s roll-out plan, starting in 2021. The CE mark was granted under the new MDR European regulation.

“This is great news for millions of migraine patients in Europe, many of whom are seeking a non-pharmacological therapy for their debilitating migraines,” said Messoud Ashina, MD, Professor of Neurology and Chief Physician at the Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark and current president of the International Headache Society. “It is important to expand the toolbox available for healthcare providers and patients in their effort to find the best therapy for each individual.”

An estimated 41 million Europeans suffer from migraine, costing the European economy more than 50 billion Euros a year. Far more than just a headache, migraine can also be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, numbness, sensitivity to light and sound and confusion.

“Nerivio combines clinical efficacy comparable to prescription drugs, with a high safety profile,” said Theranica CEO Alon Ironi. “After its successful launch in the US, Nerivio will soon provide European migraine patients with the option of a non-pharmacological treatment that can keep them safe from medication overuse headache. The ease of use, focused on rapid return to normal functioning, combined with the digital health emphasis as a smartphone-controlled wearable, is a fresh addition to the arsenal of migraine therapies.”

Nerivio is the first smartphone-controlled wearable device for the acute treatment of migraine. Placed on the upper arm at the onset of a migraine attack, the prescribed device uses remote electrical neuromodulation to wirelessly stimulate a conditioned pain modulation response to mitigate pain. A corresponding Nerivio app also keeps track of migraine episodes and provides analytics that a patient can share with their doctor, to help monitor and tailor treatment.

 The gefapixant (15mg, bid) did not meet its 1EPs in either study. Gefapixant (PO) is a selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough","Data from Phase 3 COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 Trials Presented at the Virtual European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2020

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has announced the results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials (COUGH-1 and COUGH-2) evaluating the efficacy and safety of gefapixant (MK-7264), an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 are the first companion Phase 3 trials ever conducted in patients with refractory chronic cough, a cough that persists despite appropriate treatment of underlying conditions, or unexplained chronic cough, a cough where the underlying cause cannot be identified despite a thorough evaluation. In these studies, adult patients treated with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in 24-hour cough frequency (measured objectively, as coughs per hour, using 24-hour sound recordings) versus placebo at 12 weeks (COUGH-1) (18.45% reduction relative to placebo, 95% CI [-32.92, -0.86; p=0.041]) and 24 weeks (COUGH-2) (14.64% reduction relative to placebo, 95% CI [-26.07, -1.43; p=0.031]). The gefapixant 15 mg twice daily treatment arms did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in either Phase 3 study.

“It is estimated that between 5 and 10% of adults globally suffer from chronic cough. A subset of these patients have refractory or unexplained chronic cough and appear more sensitive to various triggers that do not typically cause cough in healthy subjects. These include everyday things such as talking, laughing, a change in air temperature or exposure to aerosols or food odors, and to date treatment options are extremely limited for these patients,” said Dr. Lorcan McGarvey, Clinical Professor, Wellcome-Wolfson Institute of Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen’s University Belfast. “Given the significant unmet need for these patients, we are strongly encouraged by the findings of COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 and the potential for a new therapeutic option for patients who are struggling with the burden of this disease, often for many years without relief.”

“COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 are the first companion Phase 3 trials in refractory or unexplained chronic cough, underscoring Merck’s commitment to fully researching the potential for gefapixant in this patient population,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “Both trials met the primary endpoint at the 45 mg twice daily dosage, significantly reducing cough frequency in these patients, and we are grateful for the opportunity to share these data with the scientific community.”

These results were presented at the virtual European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2020 (abstract #3800). Merck plans to share data from COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 with regulatory authorities worldwide.

Study design and additional data from COUGH-1 and COUGH-2

COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are international Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing cough frequency in adult participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. A total of 2,044 participants(75% female, mean age 58 years, mean cough duration 11 years) were treated in COUGH-1 (n=730) and COUGH-2 (n=1,314). In both studies, patients were randomized to one of three groups: gefapixant 45 mg twice daily, gefapixant 15 mg twice daily, or placebo. Participants remained on their assigned treatment at randomization throughout both studies. The primary efficacy outcomes measure for COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were 24-hour cough frequency at Week 12, and 24-hour cough frequency at week 24, respectively, measured using an ambulatory digital audio recording device. Secondary endpoints in both trials included awake coughs per hour and percentage of participants with a greater than 1.3-point increase from baseline in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) total score. COUGH-1 had a 12-week treatment period and a 40-week extension period, while COUGH-2 had a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week extension period. Primary safety outcomes include the percentage of patients experiencing greater than one adverse event (AE) during treatment and follow up, and the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.

In COUGH-1 and COUGH-2, treatment with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily resulted in a significant reduction in objectively measured 24-hour cough frequency in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. In these studies, on average, participants receiving gefapixant 45 mg twice daily in the COUGH-1 trial experienced a 62% reduction in cough frequency, and in the COUGH-2 trial experienced a 63% reduction in cough frequency, compared with baseline.

*Estimated relative reduction (%) vs placebo was estimated by 1OO*(exp(diff) -1), where diff was the difference provided by the analysis of the log transformed variable.

The secondary endpoints in COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 support the primary observation of the studies. Awake cough frequency results were generally similar to the 24-hour cough frequency outcome, reaching statistical significance in the 45 mg twice daily group in COUGH-2 (15.79% estimated relative reduction, 95% CI [-27.27, -2.50; p=0.022]) and trending towards significance in COUGH-1 (17.68% estimated relative reduction, 95% CI [-32.57, 0.50; p=0.056]). Significantly more participants in the gefapixant 45 mg twice daily group at week 24 demonstrated a clinically important improvement in cough-related quality of life, with an odds ratio of 1.41 (p=0.042) compared with placebo. Of the participants in the 45 mg group, 77.1% experienced a clinically important level of improvement in their quality of life related to cough, as measured using the LCQ.

The safety and tolerability profile of gefapixant was consistent with that reported in previous studies. The incidence of serious AEs was similar between treatments (<4%). Discontinuations due to AEs were more frequent in the 45 mg group (15% in COUGH-1 and 20% in COUGH-2) compared to the 15 mg (3% in COUGH-1 and 8% in COUGH-2) and placebo groups (3% and 5%, respectively). Taste-related AEs occurred at higher incidence in the 45 mg group (58.0% in COUGH-1 and 68.6% in COUGH-2) compared to the 15 mg (10.7% in COUGH-1 and 19.5% in COUGH-2) and placebo (3.3% in COUGH-1 and 8.3% in COUGH-2) groups. The majority of taste-related AEs were mild to moderate.

About Gefapixant

Gefapixant is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. P2X3 receptors are one of the receptor types found on sensory nerve fibers, predominantly C fibers, in the airway lining. Chemical stimuli, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can be released from airway lining cells due to processes including airway inflammation, irritation, and mechanical stress/injury. Binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors on C fibers in the airway can be sensed as a signal of potential damage, creating an action potential, which may initiate coughing. Blockade of extracellular ATP binding to P2X3 receptors is thought to reduce sensory C fiber activation and subsequently, coughing.

About Chronic Cough

The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated at 5-10% of the general adult population globally. In a subset of these cases, patients either do not respond to treatment of underlying conditions (such as asthma or gastroesophageal reflux), known as refractory chronic cough (RCC), or they have no identifiable underlying condition despite a thorough evaluation, known as unexplained chronic cough (UCC). There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of RCC or UCC.

48091,Regenxbio Reports First Patients Dosing in its P-II AAVIATE Study of RGX-314 for Wet AMD,REGENXBIO Announces Dosing of First Patient in Phase II AAVIATE Trial of RGX-314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD Using Suprachoroidal Delivery,"The first patient has been dosed in the P-II AAVIATE trial to assess the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 (2.5×1011 GC/eye & 5×1011 GC/eye) vs ranibizumab (0.5mg, monthly, IVT) using the SCS Microinjector in ~40 patients in a ratio (3:1) with wet AMD
 The 1EPs of the study is mean change in vision in patients dosed with RGX-314, as measured by BCVA @40wks., other endpoints include mean change in CRT and number of anti-VEGF IVT received following administration of RGX-314
 The company expects to report interim data of the first cohort of the trial by the end of 2020. RGX-314 is consists of the NAV AAV8 vector, being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal conditions and has shown a positive effect in patients with wet AMD when delivered subretinally in the ongoing P-I/IIa study","– Interim data update from first cohort expected by end of 2020

– Targeted, in-office suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector® may provide additional administration options for patients with wet AMD

ROCKVILLE, Md., Sept. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — REGENXBIO Inc. (Nasdaq: RGNX), a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy based on its proprietary NAV® Technology Platform, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the AAVIATE trial, a Phase II trial to evaluate the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The Company expects to report interim data from the first cohort of this trial by the end of 2020.

“The initiation of this trial is an important milestone for REGENXBIO, as it is the first clinical trial to evaluate the delivery of any gene therapy, including RGX-314, to the suprachoroidal space. RGX-314 has shown evidence of potentially meaningful treatment effect in patients with wet AMD when delivered subretinally in the ongoing Phase I/IIa trial, and we are excited about the potential of the targeted, in-office suprachoroidal approach, which may provide additional RGX-314 delivery options for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates from this trial later this year,” said Steve Pakola, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of REGENXBIO.

AAVIATE is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, dose-escalation trial that will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 using the SCS Microinjector, a targeted, in-office route of administration. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients with severe wet AMD across two cohorts. Patients in each cohort will be randomized to receive RGX-314 versus monthly 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injection at a 3:1 ratio, and two dose levels of RGX-314 will be evaluated: 2.5×1011 GC/eye and 5×1011 GC/eye. Patients will not receive prophylactic immune suppressive corticosteroid therapy before or after administration of RGX-314.

The primary endpoint of the trial is mean change in vision in patients dosed with RGX-314, as measured by best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), at Week 40 from baseline, compared to patients receiving monthly injections of ranibizumab. Other endpoints include mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) and number of anti-VEGF intravitreal injections received following administration of RGX-314.

About RGX-314

RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal conditions. RGX-314 consists of the NAV AAV8 vector, which encodes an antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RGX-314 is believed to inhibit the VEGF pathway by which new, leaky blood vessels grow and contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the retina.

REGENXBIO is advancing two separate routes of administration of RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as delivery to the suprachoroidal space. REGENXBIO has licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector® from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.

About Wet AMD

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy.  Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.

About REGENXBIO Inc.

REGENXBIO is a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. REGENXBIO’s NAV Technology Platform, a proprietary adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery platform, consists of exclusive rights to more than 100 novel AAV vectors, including AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10. REGENXBIO and its third-party NAV Technology Platform Licensees are applying the NAV Technology Platform in the development of a broad pipeline of candidates in multiple therapeutic areas.

LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

LEMTRADA is a prescription medicine used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Since treatment with LEMTRADA can increase your risk of getting certain conditions and diseases, LEMTRADA is generally prescribed for people who have tried 2 or more MS medicines that have not worked well enough. LEMTRADA is not recommended for use in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). It is not known if LEMTRADA is safe and effective for use in children under 17 years of age.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

LEMTRADA can cause serious side effects including:

Serious autoimmune problems: Some people receiving LEMTRADA develop a condition where the immune cells in your body attack other cells or organs in the body (autoimmunity), which can be serious and may cause death. Serious autoimmune problems may include:

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a condition of reduced platelet counts in your blood that can cause severe bleeding that may cause life–threatening problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms: easy bruising; bleeding from a cut that is hard to stop; coughing up blood; heavier menstrual periods than normal; bleeding from your gums or nose that is new or takes longer than usual to stop; small, scattered spots on your skin that are red, pink, or purple
Kidney problems called anti–glomerular basement membrane disease, which, if not treated, can lead to severe kidney damage, kidney failure that needs dialysis, a kidney transplant, or death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms: swelling of your legs or feet; blood in the urine (red or tea–colored urine); decrease in urine; fatigue; coughing up blood
It is important for you to have blood and urine tests before you receive, while you are receiving and every month for 4 years or longer, after you receive your last LEMTRADA infusion.

Serious infusion reactions: LEMTRADA can cause serious infusion reactions that may cause death. Serious infusion reactions may happen while you receive, or up to 24 hours or longer after you receive LEMTRADA.

You will receive your infusion at a healthcare facility with equipment and staff trained to manage infusion reactions, including serious allergic reactions, and urgent heart or breathing problems. You will be watched while you receive, and for 2 hours or longer after you receive, LEMTRADA. If a serious infusion reaction happens while you are receiving LEMTRADA, your infusion may be stopped.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of a serious infusion reaction during the infusion, and after you have left the healthcare facility:

swelling in your mouth or throat
trouble breathing
weakness
fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat
chest pain
rash
To lower your chances of getting a serious infusion reaction, your healthcare provider will give you a medicine called corticosteroids before your first 3 infusions of a treatment course. You may also be given other medicines before or after the infusion to try to reduce your chances of having these reactions or to treat them if they happen.

Stroke and tears in your arteries that supply blood to your brain (carotid and vertebral arteries): Some people have had serious and sometimes deadly strokes and tears in their carotid or vertebral arteries within 3 days of receiving LEMTRADA. Get help right away if you have any of the following symptoms that may be signs of a stroke or tears in your carotid or vertebral arteries:

drooping of parts of your face
weakness on one side
sudden severe headache
difficulty with speech
neck pain
Certain cancers: Receiving LEMTRADA may increase your chance of getting some kinds of cancers, including thyroid cancer, skin cancer (melanoma), and blood cancers called lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoma. Call your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms that may be a sign of thyroid cancer:

new lump
swelling in your neck
pain in front of neck
hoarseness or other voice changes that do not go away
trouble swallowing or breathing
cough that is not caused by a cold
Have your skin checked before you start receiving LEMTRADA and each year while you are receiving treatment to monitor for symptoms of skin cancer.

Because of risks of autoimmunity, infusion reactions, and some kinds of cancers, LEMTRADA is only available through a restricted program called the LEMTRADA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program.

Do not receive LEMTRADA if you are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Thyroid problems: Some patients taking LEMTRADA may get an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Call your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms:

excessive sweating
unexplained weight loss
fast heartbeat
eye swelling
nervousness
unexplained weight gain
feeling cold
worsening tiredness
constipation
Low blood counts (cytopenias): LEMTRADA may cause a decrease in some types of blood cells. Some people with these low blood counts have increased infections. Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms of cytopenias such as:

weakness
chest pain
yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice)
dark urine
fast heartbeat
Inflammation of the liver: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms such as unexplained nausea, stomach pain, tiredness, loss of appetite, yellowing of skin or whites of eyes, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: LEMTRADA may increase the risk of overactivity of the immune system that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you experience symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, or skin rash, contact your healthcare provider right away.

Serious infections: LEMTRADA may cause you to have a serious infection while you receive and after receiving a course of treatment. Serious infections may include:

 listeria. People who receive LEMTRADA have an increased chance of getting a bacterial infection called listeria, which can lead to significant complications or death. Avoid foods that may be a source of listeria or make sure foods are heated well.
 herpes viral infections. Some people taking LEMTRADA have an increased chance of getting herpes viral infections. Take medicines as prescribed by your healthcare provider to reduce your chances of getting these infections.
 tuberculosis. Your healthcare provider should check you for tuberculosis before you receive LEMTRADA.
 hepatitis. People who are at high risk of, or are carriers of, hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) may be at risk of irreversible liver damage.
These are not all the possible infections that could happen while on LEMTRADA. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of a serious infection such as fever or swollen glands. Talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinations after receiving LEMTRADA. Certain vaccinations may increase your chances of getting infections.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): A rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability has been reported with LEMTRADA. Symptoms of PML get worse over days to weeks. It is important that you call your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems that have lasted several days, including problems with:

thinking
eyesight
strength
balance
weakness on 1 side of your body
using your arms or legs
Inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis): LEMTRADA may increase your chance of getting inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, a serious medical condition that can be life-threatening. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

stomach pain or discomfort
fever
nausea or vomiting
Swelling of lung tissue (pneumonitis): Some people have had swelling of the lung tissue while receiving LEMTRADA. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have the following symptoms:

shortness of breath
cough
wheezing
chest pain or tightness
coughing up blood
Before receiving LEMTRADA, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have bleeding, thyroid, or kidney problems
have a recent history of infection

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you should receive LEMTRADA or breastfeed.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over–the–counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. LEMTRADA and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take medicines that increase your chance of getting infections, including medicines used to treat cancer or to control your immune system.

The most common side effects of LEMTRADA include:

rash
headache
thyroid problems
fever
swelling of your nose and throat
nausea
urinary tract infection
feeling tired
trouble sleeping
upper respiratory infection
herpes viral infection
hives

Digitally-powered drug discovery to address fibrotic diseases with previously undiscovered mechanisms and to deliver novel therapies to patients faster
September 09, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BERLIN & SALT LAKE CITY–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bayer and US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a digital biology company industrializing drug discovery, have entered into a strategic collaboration agreement. The partnership will leverage Recursion’s purpose-built artificial intelligence-guided drug discovery platform and Bayer’s small molecule compound library and deep scientific expertise to discover and develop new treatments for fibrotic diseases of the lung, kidney, heart and more. In addition, Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of Bayer AG, is leading Recursion’s Series D financing with an investment of USD 50 million.

“We are driving forward digital transformation in R&D as we believe that digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, offer a myriad of novel opportunities to address the complex biology of many diseases and identify new treatments for patients,” said Joerg Moeller, MD, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “The collaboration with Recursion enables us to discover small molecule drug candidates targeting novel biology for the treatment of fibrotic diseases and complements our expertise in cardiovascular research with digital technologies.”

Fibrotic diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the biggest challenges in the treatment of fibrotic diseases is the underlying complex biology and the associated difficulty in discovering relevant drug targets. Phenotypic screening is a method to screen for novel therapeutic molecules to uncover novel drug targets and their role in complex disease processes. Artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning methods allow the processing of enormous amounts of data—including high-resolution imaging—generated by these screens and offers unprecedented potential for the discovery of new drug candidates for diseases with complex biology such as fibrotic diseases.

“Leaps by Bayer invests in paradigm-shifting advances in the life sciences and artificial intelligence might be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time,” said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer. “Recursion is a leading digitally-powered drug discovery company to lift biotech research to new horizons with the use of artificial intelligence and pioneers transformational machine-learning powered drug discovery with the potential to develop curative treatments in the future.”

Recursion’s drug discovery platform combines highly automated, wet lab biology experiments as the base for iterative learning through its computational tools. The purpose-built drug-discovery platform is based on a proprietary library of over half a billion images of human cells from more than 33 million experiments conducted in-house at Recursion and coupled with advanced data analytics based on machine learning. To date, Recursion has on-boarded over 750 cellular disease models to broadly interrogate diverse therapeutic areas.

“Many of the most significant innovations of this century will occur at the intersection of biology and technology. We believe that our vision of using technology to unravel the exceptional complexity of biological systems will lead to next generation biotherapeutics at unprecedented speed, scale and precision,” said Chris Gibson, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Recursion. “We have the potential to elucidate novel biological pathways, targets and chemical entities across large disease domains such as fibrosis, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and targeted oncology, which we believe will form the basis of early partnerships with key pharma stakeholders.”

Under the terms of the agreement, the parties may initiate more than ten programs with possible development and commercial milestone payments of more than USD 100 million per program plus royalties on future sales. Bayer will gain the option to exclusively license novel therapeutics derived from the research activities. Bayer will contribute with its small molecule compound library and expertise in biology and medicinal chemistry. In addition to the USD 50 million equity investment, Recursion will receive an upfront payment of USD 30 million.

The Pharmaceuticals Business Development & Licensing team of Bayer facilitated the license, research collaboration and option agreement of this deal.

48286,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Fasenra (benralizumab) in P-III OSTRO Study for Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,Fasenra met both co-primary endpoints of reduced nasal polyp size and blockage in the OSTRO Phase III trial for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps,"The P-III OSTRO study involves assessing of Fasenra (30mg, SC, q4w for first three doses and q8w thereafter) vs PBO in 413 patients with nasal polyposis who were still symptomatic despite continued treatment with SoC for 56wks. across EU and North America
 Results: Improvement in the size of nasal polyps and in nasal blockage in patients with CRSwNP, improvement in the endoscopic total NPS and the NBS, safety profile and tolerability of therapy were consistent with the known profile of the medicine
 Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan, and other countries and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU, and other countries","10 September 2020 07:00 BST
High-level results from the OSTRO Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s Fasenra (benralizumab) compared with placebo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the size of nasal polyps and in nasal blockage in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).

Fasenra demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the endoscopic total nasal polyp score (NPS) and the nasal blockage score (NBS) compared to placebo, in patients with severe bilateral nasal polyposis who were still symptomatic despite continued treatment with standard of care (SoC). SoC consists of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) and prior surgery and/or use of systemic corticosteroids. Evaluation of NPS was based on a physician assessment of polyp size during endoscopy. NBS evaluation was based on a patient-reported symptoms diary.

CRSwNP is an inflammatory disease associated with elevated levels of eosinophils in the upper respiratory tract and characterised by benign growths called nasal polyps.1,2 Polyps can cause nasal blockage and discharge, reduction or loss in the sense of smell, sleep disturbances and other adverse effects on quality of life.3-5

Professor Claus Bachert, Head of the Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Chair of the Upper Airway Research Laboratory, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium, the principal investigator of the trial, said: “Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is difficult to treat and the underlying drivers and natural history of the disease are not fully established. The OSTRO results show that Fasenra’s eosinophil-depleting mechanism of action may benefit patients with this often debilitating condition.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps suffer significantly with nasal congestion and a reduced quality of life. Current treatments, such as intranasal or oral corticosteroids and surgery to remove polyps, do not fully address patient needs. The OSTRO data indicate Fasenra can benefit patients with nasal polyps. We look forward to completing the full analysis and sharing these results at an upcoming medical meeting.”

The safety profile and tolerability of Fasenra in this trial were consistent with the known profile of the medicine.

Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is characterised by persistent inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages and sinuses accompanied by benign growths, called nasal polyps.6,7 Nasal polyps can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, reduction in the sense of smell, nasal discharge, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life.3-5 The disease is associated with elevated levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, accumulating in the upper respiratory tract.2

Current treatments for nasal polyps include intranasal or oral corticosteroids (OCS) and surgery to remove polyps, but these often do not address the underlying cause of the disease and the need for repeated interventions can be high. Since 2019, other biologic medicines have been approved or recommended to treat nasal polyps.4,10

OSTRO is part of AstraZeneca’s clinical trial programme for Fasenra in CRSwNP which also includes the ongoing Phase III ORCHID trial, among others.11

OSTRO

OSTRO is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 56-week Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fasenra compared to placebo in patients with nasal polyposis.12 Fasenra was evaluated in patients, regardless of blood eosinophil count with or without asthma, who were symptomatic despite SoC therapy, including current use of INCS and prior surgery and/or use of systemic corticosteroids. Patients were randomised to receive either Fasenra 30mg or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks for the first three doses and every eight weeks thereafter.12

The primary outcome measures of the trial were: the effect of Fasenra on nasal polyp burden, assessed by change from baseline in endoscopic total NPS, at week 40 compared to placebo; the effect of Fasenra on patient-reported nasal blockage, assessed by change from baseline in mean NBS, at week 40 compared to placebo. OSTRO involved 413 patients in Europe and North America.12

Fasenra

Fasenra (benralizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).13,14

Fasenra is in development for other eosinophilic diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.15-19 The US Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in 2018, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis in 2019.

Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Building on a 50-year heritage, AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care across inhaled and biologic medicines. AstraZeneca aims to transform the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by eliminating preventable asthma attacks across all severities and removing COPD as a leading cause of death through earlier, biology-led treatment.

The proposed supply agreement with the European Commission would represent the largest initial order of vaccine doses for Pfizer and BioNTech to date. Vaccine doses for Europe would be produced in BioNTech’s German manufacturing sites, as well as in Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Belgium. If regulatory approval for the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is received, the European Commission would lead the process for allocation of the vaccine doses among the 27 EU Member States.

“Pfizer and BioNTech’s anticipated agreement with the European Commission is an important step forward in our shared goal to have millions of doses of a vaccine against COVID-19 available for vulnerable populations before the end of the year. We would like to thank the European Commission for its commitment and confidence in our development efforts,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer. “We have activated our supply chain, most importantly our site in Belgium, and are starting to manufacture so that our vaccine would be available as soon as possible, if our clinical trials prove successful and regulatory approval is granted.”

“As a company founded in the heart of Europe, we are pleased to have concluded exploratory discussions with the European Commission, which would be our largest initial order to date. Our aim is to develop a safe and effective vaccine to contribute to bringing this pandemic to an end in Europe and across the world. Today’s decision is a further illustration of how collaboration and solidarity can help address a global health crisis as an international community,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

In addition to engagements with governments, Pfizer and BioNTech have provided an expression of interest for possible supply to the COVAX Facility, a mechanism established by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organization (WHO) that, using a range of technology platforms, aims to provide governments, including those in the emerging markets, with early access to a large portfolio of COVID-19 candidate vaccines produced by multiple manufacturers across the world.

About the BNT162 Vaccine Candidate Program

The BNT162 program is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. Two of the companies’ four investigational vaccine candidates – BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 – received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on preliminary data from Phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the U.S. and Germany as well as animal immunogenicity studies. During preclinical and clinical studies, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 emerged as strong candidates based on assessments of safety and immune response.

On July 27, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that following extensive review of preclinical and clinical data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and in consultation with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and other global regulators, the companies selected the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate to move forward into a Phase 2/3 study. BNT162b2 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies.

About the Phase 2/3 Study

In the late-stage trial, Pfizer and BioNTech are studying a 30µg dose level in a 2-dose regimen among up to 30,000 participants aged 18 to 85 years. The companies have selected approximately 120 sites globally, including those in regions with significant expected SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and are working to reach a diverse population and enroll those volunteers at increased risk for the infection with the virus. The Phase 2/3 trial enrollment to date has exceeded 25,000 participants with a second dose underway. Assuming clinical success, Pfizer and BioNTech are on track to seek regulatory review for BNT162b2 as early as October 2020 and, if regulatory authorization or approval is obtained, currently plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and approximately 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. To meet those anticipated quantities and milestones, the companies have produced sufficient supply for their 30,000 participant Phase 2/3 clinical trial and have begun to produce and stockpile their pandemic supply.

The BNT162 vaccine candidate is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. Both collaborators are committed to developing these novel vaccines with preclinical and clinical data at the forefront of all their decision making.

September 10, 2020 01:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), will present new Enspryng™ (satralizumab-mwge) data on reducing relapse severity in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a rare disease of the central nervous system. These data are being presented at MSVirtual2020, the 8th Joint Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) – European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) Meeting, in addition to longer-term efficacy data supporting the continued effect of Enspryng on reducing the risk of NMOSD relapse, as well as its favorable benefit:risk profile.

“Enspryng is the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous, self-administered medicine for NMOSD and the first medicine for NMOSD that is designed to target the interleukin-6 receptor, which is believed to play a key role in the inflammation associated with this disorder.”

“The data for Enspryng at MSVirtual2020 are promising and suggest it significantly reduces relapse severity and frequency, which are important goals of the treatment for people with NMOSD,” said Anthony Traboulsee, M.D., neurologist and professor, University of British Columbia, and Research Chair of the MS Society of Canada. “Enspryng, the first approved treatment for NMOSD that can be taken at home, offers favorable efficacy and safety, which are important for improved long-term outcomes.’’

In a post-hoc analysis of the Enspryng-treated group, the risk of severe relapse was reduced by 79% compared to placebo (5 of 27 [19%] vs. 12 of 34 [35%]), for patients across the double-blind periods of the SAkura studies. Preventing relapses, the most severe of which cause cumulative, irreversible, neurological damage and disability, is the primary goal for NMOSD treatment management. The patients treated with Enspryng were also less likely to require rescue therapy for a relapse compared with placebo (OR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25–0.86, p=0.015). A relapse was categorized as severe if it resulted in a change of ≥2 points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale.

In a separate pooled analysis, Enspryng reduced the risk of relapse in the combined double-blind period and open-label extension (OLE) by 51% (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31–0.79; p=0.002) compared to those originally in the placebo group. This effect was more pronounced in aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) seropositive patients, who tend to experience a more severe disease course, with 66% reduction in risk of relapse (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.62; p<0.001) compared to those originally in the placebo group.

“The longer-term data for Enspryng further reinforce the previously observed efficacy of this medicine for this debilitating disorder that is often mistaken for multiple sclerosis,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Enspryng is the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous, self-administered medicine for NMOSD and the first medicine for NMOSD that is designed to target the interleukin-6 receptor, which is believed to play a key role in the inflammation associated with this disorder.”

In the double-blind periods, infection rates were lower in the Enspryng-treated group compared to placebo in the SAkuraStar study (99.8 vs. 162.6 events/100 patient years [PY]), whereas infection rates did not differ between groups in the SAkuraSky study. Serious infection rates were comparable between both groups in each of the studies (SAkuraSky: 2.6 vs. 5.0 events/100PY; SAkuraStar: 5.2 vs. 9.9 events/100PY). Infection and serious infection rates for Enspryng-treated patients in the combined double-blind and OLE periods were consistent with those for Enspryng-treated patients in the double-blind portion in terms of the nature and rate of adverse events and did not increase over time.

Enspryng is approved in Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the U.S. Additional applications are under review with numerous regulators, including in the EU and China. Enspryng has been designated as an orphan drug in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018.

About SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky in NMOSD

SAkuraStar is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Enspryng monotherapy administered to patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The primary endpoint is the time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR), adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraStar study were presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), September 11-13, 2019, and were published in the May 1, 2020 edition of The Lancet Neurology.

Ninety-five adult patients were randomized to either of the following two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: Enspryng (120 mg) or placebo. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended at 1.5 years after the enrollment of the last patient. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with Enspryng in an open label extension (OLE) period. Patients with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by the diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. The number of AQP4 antibody negative patients was limited to approximately 33% of the total population of the study. Data have shown that AQP4 antibody positive patients may experience a greater likelihood of relapse and poorer long-term outcomes than AQP4 antibody negative patients.

SAkuraSky is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Enspryng added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy in patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was the time to first PDR as adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraSky study were published in the November 28, 2019 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Seventy-six adult patients were randomized to either of the following two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: Enspryng (120 mg) or placebo added to baseline therapy (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and/or corticosteroids). Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended when patients experienced a PDR; the study ended when the total number of PDRs reached 26. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with Enspryng in an OLE period. Patients with AQP4 antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. AQP4 antibody negative patients represented approximately 30% of the SAkuraSky study population.

About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)

NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune condition of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, up to 15,000 people in the United States and approximately 200,000 people worldwide. NMOSD can affect individuals of any age, race and gender, but is most common among women in their 30s and 40s, and appears to occur at higher rates in people of African or Asian background. There is some evidence that people of African or Asian descent may also experience a more severe disease course.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4 antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of NMOSD patients.

Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through diagnostic tests, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping characteristics of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that both are relapse-based conditions.

About Enspryng™ (satralizumab-mwge)

Enspryng, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche Group, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor activity. The cytokine IL-6 is believed to be a key driver in NMOSD, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. Enspryng was designed using novel recycling antibody technology, which compared to conventional technology, allows for longer duration of the antibody and subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

Positive Phase III results for Enspryng, as both monotherapy and used concurrently with baseline immunosuppressant therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The Phase III clinical development program for Enspryng includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

Enspryng is approved in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Switzerland. Applications are under review with numerous regulators, including in the EU and China.

Enspryng has been designated as an orphan drug in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018.

What is Enspryng?

Enspryng is a prescription medicine used to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults who are aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.

It is not known if Enspryng is safe and effective in children.

Important Safety Information

are allergic to satralizumab-mwge or any of the ingredients in Enspryng
have an active hepatitis B infection
have active or untreated inactive (latent) tuberculosis (TB)
Enspryng may cause serious side effects including:

Infections. Enspryng can increase risk of serious infections some of which can be life-threatening. Patients should speak with their healthcare provider if they are being treated for an infection and call right away if there are signs of an infection, with or without a fever, such as:
chills, feeling tired, muscle aches, cough that will not go away or a sore throat
skin redness, swelling, tenderness, pain or sores on the body
diarrhea, belly pain, or feeling sick
burning when urinating or urinating more often than usual
A healthcare provider will check for infection and treat it if needed before starting or continuing to take Enspryng

A healthcare provider should test for hepatitis and TB before initiating Enspryng
All required vaccinations should be completed before starting Enspryng. People using Enspryng should not be given ‘live’ or ‘live-attenuated’ vaccines. ‘Live’ or ‘live-attenuated’ vaccines should be given at least 4 weeks before a patient starts Enspryng. A healthcare provider may recommend that a patient receive a ‘non-live’ (inactivated) vaccine, such as some of the seasonal flu vaccines. If a patient plans to get a ‘non-live’ (inactivated) vaccine it should be given, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks before starting Enspryng

 Ninlaro (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor, being studies across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings","– TOURMALINE-MM2 Data Presented Virtually at the Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) Eighth Annual Meeting

Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, JAPAN, September 9, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced results from the Phase 3 TOURMALINE-MM2 trial evaluating the addition of NINLARO™ (ixazomib) to lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone plus placebo in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. These data will be presented at the virtual scientific meeting of the Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) on Wednesday, September 9, 2020 at 6:15 p.m. CT.

The study found the addition of NINLARO to lenalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in a 13.5 month increase in median progression-free survival (PFS) (35.3 months in the NINLARO arm, compared to 21.8 months in the placebo arm; hazard ratio [HR] 0.830; p=0.073). The trial did not meet the threshold for statistical significance and the primary endpoint of PFS was not met.

“There is a specific need in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, given there are currently no approved all-oral, proteasome inhibitor-based treatment options,” said Thierry Facon, MD, Lille University Hospital, principal investigator and lead author of TOURMALINE-MM2. “Findings from the TOURMALINE-MM2 trial are important overall for this patient population as well as across multiple subgroups including patients with high-risk cytogenetics. We hope these data will help inform future research and further progress for the multiple myeloma community.”

Other endpoints presented include complete response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) and median time to progression (TTP). The safety profile associated with NINLARO from the trial was generally consistent with the existing prescribing information.

“We hope the findings from the TOURMALINE-MM2 trial will encourage constructive conversations and help progress future research efforts, particularly for patients who could benefit from an all-oral, proteasome inhibitor-based combination that helps preserve quality of life,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “As a company, we remain committed to the multiple myeloma community and look forward to sharing mature data from our ongoing Phase 3 multiple myeloma maintenance studies in the future.”

Key findings to be presented by TOURMALINE-MM2 trial investigator, Shaji Kumar, MD, Mayo Clinic, include:

In the prespecified expanded high-risk cytogenetics subgroup, median PFS was 23.8 months in the NINLARO arm versus 18.0 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.690).
The rate of CR, a key secondary endpoint in the trial, was 26% in the NINLARO arm versus 14% in the placebo arm.
After a median follow up of 57.8 months in the NINLARO arm versus 58.6 months in the placebo arm for OS, the median OS was not reached in either arm (HR 0.998).
Median TTP was longer with the NINLARO combination versus placebo, at 45.8 months in the NINLARO arm versus 26.8 months in the placebo arm (HR 0.738).
Safety data include:
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 96.6% of patients receiving NINLARO plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to 92.6% of patients receiving placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
The most common TEAEs of clinical importance in the NINLARO arm were diarrhea, rash, peripheral edema, constipation and nausea.
Grade ≥3 TEAEs were experienced by 88.1% of patients receiving NINLARO versus 81.4% receiving placebo.
The majority of TEAEs were managed without discontinuation, with TEAEs resulting in 35% regimen discontinuation in the NINLARO arm and 26.9% in the placebo arm.
The rate of on-study deaths was 7.6% in the NINLARO arm and 6.3% in the placebo arm.
“Insights from studies like TOURMALINE-MM2 are important, especially to those patients who may benefit from the convenience of treatment options that can be taken at home,” said Paul Giusti, President and Chief Executive Officer, Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF). “These critical learnings enable the community to comprehensively assess the different treatment combinations available for patients and physicians.”

NINLARO is currently approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in more than 65 countries. NINLARO is not approved as a treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

About the TOURMALINE-MM2 Trial
TOURMALINE-MM2 is an international, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, designed to evaluate NINLAROTM (ixazomib) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone, in 705 adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not candidates for transplant. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints include rate of complete response (CR), pain response and overall survival (OS).

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening rare blood cancer that arises from the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that is made in the bone marrow. These plasma cells become abnormal, multiply and release a type of antibody known as a paraprotein, which causes symptoms of the disease, including bone pain, frequent or recurring infections and fatigue, a symptom of anemia. These malignant plasma cells have the potential to affect many bones in the body and can cause a number of serious health problems affecting the bones, immune system, kidneys and red blood cell count. The typical multiple myeloma disease course includes periods of symptomatic myeloma followed by periods of remission. Nearly 230,000 people around the world live with multiple myeloma, with approximately 114,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year.

About NINLAROTM (ixazomib) capsules
NINLARO™ (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor which is being studied across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings. NINLARO was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 and is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. NINLARO is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, Japan and in the European Union, with nine regulatory filings currently under review. It was the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and to receive approval. In Japan, NINLARO is approved as a maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant and has been filed for maintenance therapy in patients ineligible for stem cell transplant.

NINLAROTM (ixazomib): GLOBAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Thrombocytopenia has been reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively) with platelet nadirs typically occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. It did not result in an increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions. Monitor platelet counts at least monthly during treatment with NINLARO and consider more frequent monitoring during the first three cycles. Manage with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.

Gastrointestinal toxicities have been reported in the NINLARO and placebo regimens respectively, such as diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), and vomiting (22% vs. 11%), occasionally requiring use of antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and supportive care.

Peripheral neuropathy was reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 21% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (< 1%). Monitor patients for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and adjust dosing as needed.

Peripheral edema was reported with NINLARO (25% vs. 18% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Evaluate patients for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. Adjust the dose of dexamethasone per its prescribing information or the dose of NINLARO for severe symptoms

Cutaneous reactions occurred in 19% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 11% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular rash. Manage rash with supportive care, dose modification or discontinuation.

Thrombotic microangiopathy, sometimes fatal, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), have been reported in patients who received NINLARO. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TPP/HUS and stop NINLARO if diagnosis is suspected. If the diagnosis of TPP/HUS is excluded, consider restarting NINLARO. The safety of reinitiating NINLARO therapy in patients previously experiencing TPP/HUS is not known.

Hepatotoxicity, drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic have been uncommonly reported with NINLARO. Monitor hepatic enzymes regularly and adjust dose for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms.

Pregnancy– NINLARO can cause fetal harm. Advise male and female patients of reproductive potential to use contraceptive measures during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the final dose of NINLARO. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking NINLARO due to potential hazard to the fetus. Women using hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception.

Lactation– It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There could be potential adverse events in nursing infants and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.

SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS

Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

Renal Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. NINLARO is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with NINLARO is not recommended.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in the NINLARO regimen, and greater than in the placebo regimen, were diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), peripheral edema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhea (2%). For each adverse reaction, one or more of the three drugs was discontinued in ≤ 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen.

48333,"Henlius Reports NMPA's Acceptance of NDA for HLX04 (biosimilar, bevacizumab)",Henlius Bevacizumab Biosimilar Received NDA Acceptance Notification from NMPA,"NMPA has accepted the NDA of HLX04, based on the series of study data, including comparative pharmaceutical quality studies, comparative non-clinical studies & clinical studies. The NDA acceptance makes HLX04 the fourth product of Henlius that has received NMPA’s NDA acceptance & can be potentially used for the treatment of advanced/ metastatic or recurrent NSCLC and metastatic colorectal cancer
 The P-III study assessing the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of HLX04 or the reference bevacizumab + oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine-based CT (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) as a 1L treatment in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
 The study met its 1EPs of PFS @36wks.and has shown similarity to the reference product in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Additionally, Henlius is evaluating the HLX04 in combination with HLX10 for the treatment of solid tumors and is the first dual mAb combo therapy that has received IND approval","Shanghai, China, September 9th, 2020 –Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the New Drug Application (NDA) of its bevacizumab biosimilar HLX04 has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). HLX04, which becomes the fourth product of Henlius that has received NDA acceptance notification from NMPA, can be potentially used for the treatment of advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. Henlius has previously submitted NDAs for its rituximab biosimilar 汉利康®, trastuzumab biosimilar 汉曲优®（HLX02, EU brand name: Zercepac®）and adalimumab HLX03. The NDAs of 汉利康® and 汉曲优® have been approved successively.
HLX04 was developed with the bevacizumab originator as reference product and the development process is in line with China’s biosimilar guidelines. Via specific binding with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HLX04 can block the interaction between VEGF and its receptors. This will inhibit tumour angiogenesis, which is essential for the growth and metastases of tumour.
The NDA of HLX04 is mainly supported by a series of study data, including comparative pharmaceutical quality studies, comparative non-clinical studies, comparative clinical studies. Different from currently approved bevacizumab biosimilars in China, the phase 3 study of HLX04 was conducted among Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, which helps to accumulate more clinical evidence and experience of bevacizumab in this patient population. Recently, this study has reached its primary and secondary endpoints. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial aimed to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX04 or the reference bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint of this comparative study, progression-free survival rate at week 36 (PFSR36w), was met after the database lock (DBL) as assessed by committee. Study results show that HLX04 is similar to the reference product in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Detailed data of this phase 3 study will be presented on 19th September by Professor Li Jin, the leading principle investigator of this study, during the 23rd annual conference of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO).
Among all malignant tumours, lung cancer has the highest incidence both in China and around the globe and is the leading cause of cancer death. According to GLOBOCAN data, there is estimated to be 774,000 new cases of lung cancer and around 690,000 patients die of lung cancer in 2018. Non-small cell lung cancer take up to 80%-85% of all lung cancer cases, making it the most common type of lung cancers. The incidence of colorectal cancer ranks second among all malignant tumours in China, with 522,000 new cases in 2018. Clinical study showed that adding bevacizumab to traditional chemotherapies can significantly delay disease progression and prolong survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, due to reasons like drug accessibility, there still exists unmet medical needs of bevacizumab in China. According to Frost & Sullivan, sales of bevacizumab has reached RMB 320 million in 2018. With the launching of bevacizumab biosimilars and with more bevacizumab combos being approved, sales of bevacizumab has the potential to reach RMB 1.77 billion in 2030.
Leveraging Henlius’ broad pipeline, the company is actively developing combo therapies of HLX04 and its anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) HLX10 for the treatment of various solid tumours. Of note is that HLX04 plus HLX10 is the first domestic dual mAb combo therapy that has received IND approval. Clinical development of this combo in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients has entered pivotal phase 3 stage. The design of this study has taken into consideration advantages of other similar trials and has its own innovations as well. It is a three-arm study to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of HLX10 and chemotherapy, the combination of HLX10, HLX04 and chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone. Clinical development of HLX10 and HLX04 combination among second-line liver cancer patients has entered phase 2. Currently, there are few studies exploring combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis drugs in this patient population in China and this phase 2 study is in a leading position in this area. In addition, Henlius is also developing HLX04 for ophthalmic diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, with the aim to benefit a broader patient population.
Dr. Scott Liu, co-founder and CEO of Henlius, said, “I am glad that the NDA of HLX04 has been accepted by NMPA. HLX04 has the potential to become the fourth commercialised product of Henlius, which means that we may be able to bring more quality treatment options to cancer patients in the near future and will be one-step closer to Henlius’ vision and mission. We will continue building up our innovation pipeline and strengthening our global footprint to steadily move towards our goal to become the most trusted and admired biotech company.

75% of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and suboptimal response to prior treatment had no evidence of disease activity two years after switching to OCREVUS in open-label Phase IIIb CASTING study
97% persistence and strong adherence to OCREVUS treatment and twice-yearly dosing schedule from real-world data
OCREVUS is the first and only treatment approved for both relapsing MS (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) and now more than 170,000 people have been treated with OCREVUS globally in clinical trial and real-world settings; favourable benefit-risk profile remains consistent over 7 years

Basel, 11 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced new data that show OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) is a highly effective treatment option for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who experienced a suboptimal response to their prior disease modifying therapy (DMT). Subgroup analysis from the two-year open-label Phase IIIb CASTING study also demonstrates that patients benefit across a wide range of disease related and demographic subgroups, regardless of prior treatment background. Findings will be presented at MSVirtual2020, the 8th Joint Meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS).

“For a wide range of people with MS who experienced a suboptimal response to prior treatment, we continue to see evidence that OCREVUS provides significant benefit in slowing disease progression,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “New real-world OCREVUS data show high persistence and adherence to the only B-cell therapy with a twice-yearly dosing schedule, which we know can be very important to both people with MS and their physicians.”

Phase IIIb open-label CASTING study
Approximately 75% of RRMS patients (492/658) had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA; brain lesions, relapses and worsening of disability) two years after switching to twice-yearly OCREVUS treatment (with prespecified MRI re-baselining at 8 weeks) in the primary analysis of the CASTING study. Patients enrolled in the study had prior suboptimal response to at least six months of treatment with up to two DMTs. The analysis also showed the proportion of patients achieving NEDA remained consistently high across all measured patient subgroups, including baseline MRI activity, relapse activity, disability level, age and the number of prior DMTs. Further, 78% of patients treated with only one prior DMT compared with 70% of patients treated with two prior DMTs achieved NEDA.

Additionally, patients treated with OCREVUS experienced an improvement in the majority of symptoms measured by SymptoMScreen after two years. SymptoMScreen is a patient-reported outcome tool to assess symptom severity across twelve domains. The most pronounced significant improvements (p<0.001) were seen in sensory symptoms, fatigue and vision, which are important for daily living.

CONFIDENCE real-world safety study
A 97% treatment persistence for OCREVUS patients at 18 months, and strong adherence to infusions every six months, was seen in an interim analysis of more than 1,600 patients in the ongoing German CONFIDENCE study. Separate data from a U.S. commercial claims database that support high persistence and sustained adherence to OCREVUS treatment will also be presented.

OCREVUS longer-term safety data
New safety data as of January 2020 will be presented, representing 5,680 patients with RMS and PPMS and 18,218 patient-years of exposure to OCREVUS, across all OCREVUS clinical trials. These findings further demonstrate the consistently favourable benefit-risk profile of OCREVUS over seven years.

With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 170,000 people treated globally, OCREVUS has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS [SPMS], in addition to clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). OCREVUS is approved in 92 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and the European Union.

About multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects nearly 1 million people in the U.S. and more than 2.3 million people worldwide. MS occurs when the immune system abnormally attacks the insulation and support around nerve cells (myelin sheath) in the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves), causing inflammation and consequent damage. This damage can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue and difficulty seeing, and may eventually lead to disability. Most people with MS experience their first symptom between 20 and 40 years of age, making the disease the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in younger adults.

People with all forms of MS experience disease progression – permanent loss of nerve cells in the central nervous system and gradual worsening of disability – at the beginning of their disease even if their clinical symptoms aren’t apparent or don’t appear to be getting worse. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can negatively impact people with MS, both in terms of their physical, mental and financial health. An important goal of treating MS is to slow the progression of disability as early as possible.

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease and is characterised by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. Approximately 85% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) include people with RRMS and people with SPMS who continue to experience relapses. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a debilitating form of the disease marked by steadily worsening symptoms but typically without distinct relapses or periods of remission. Approximately 15% of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form of the disease. Until the FDA approval of OCREVUS, there had been no FDA approved treatments for PPMS.

About OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab)
OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including clinically isolated syndrome, RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

48347,GSK and Innoviva's Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI) Receive the US FDA's Approval for Asthma and COPD,FDA approves Trelegy Ellipta as the first once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the treatment of both asthma and COPD in the US,"The approval is based on an sNDA which includes data from CAPTAIN study assessing Trelegy (qd, 100/62.5/25, 200/62.5/25, 100/31.25/25, and 200/31.25/25 mcg) vs FF/VI (100/25 and 200/25 mcg) to patients whose asthma was inadequately controlled despite treatment with ICS/LABA
 Results: Trelegy (qd, easy-to-use inhaler) demonstrated improvements in lung function, presented at ERS Congress. The FDA-approved strength for both COPD and asthma is FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25mcg) and additional strength for asthma alone is FF/UMEC/VI (200/62.5/25mcg)
 Trelegy is the first single inhaler triple therapy approved for the maintenance treatment of both asthma and COPD and is the only single inhaler triple therapy available for patients in a convenient once-daily inhalation in the US","Issued: 9 September 2020, London UK
New asthma indication for Trelegy Ellipta introduces an important option for patients to the current treatment paradigm
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new indication for Trelegy Ellipta (fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium / vilanterol ‘FF/UMEC/VI’) for the treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older adding to its current license for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Trelegy Ellipta is not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm.

The FDA-approved strength for both COPD and asthma is fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium / vilanterol 100/62.5/25mcg. There is an additional strength for asthma alone which is fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium / vilanterol 200/62.5/25mcg.

The approval means Trelegy is the first single inhaler triple therapy approved for the maintenance treatment of both asthma and COPD and is the only single inhaler triple therapy available for patients in a convenient once-daily inhalation in the US. Today’s announcement marks GSK’s sixth major medicine approval in 2020 across areas of significant unmet medical need including cancer, HIV, respiratory and chronic kidney disease.

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Millions of asthma patients in the US rely on multiple inhalers to help control their condition and manage their symptoms. Today’s approval is an important advance for these patients as it allows them to benefit from triple therapy by using one inhaler, once-a-day.”

Trelegy’s approval for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older introduces a new paradigm for managing the approximately 30% of adult asthma patients who still experience symptoms despite being adherent to inhaled corticosteroids/ long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) combination therapy.

Tonya Winders, President, Global Allergy and Airways Patient Platform (GAAPP) commented: “In the US there are almost 20 million adults[i] living with asthma and we know that many of those continue to live with and adapt their lives around ongoing symptoms, despite taking medication as prescribed by their physician. We welcome the news that for appropriate patients, Trelegy Ellipta will now be available as a new treatment option.”

Today’s approval was based on a supplemental New Drug Application which included data from the CAPTAIN study showing that in patients uncontrolled on ICS/LABA, the additional bronchodilation provided by Trelegy demonstrated significant improvements in lung function compared with FF/VI, in a single daily dose in an easy-to-use inhaler. The results from CAPTAIN were presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress this week, reinforcing the potential of once-daily single inhaler triple therapy in asthma management.

Pavel Raifeld, Chief Executive Officer of Innoviva, said: “In 2017, Trelegy Ellipta was approved in the US as the first once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the treatment of COPD, and it remains the market leader with strong continued growth. Today’s approval in asthma is another successful outcome for our long-standing partnership with GSK and a testament to our commitment to make innovative medicines accessible to patients with respiratory diseases.”

About asthma

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma affects 358 million people worldwide. Despite medical advances, more than half of patients continue to experience poor control and significant symptoms impacting their daily lives.

The causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a person’s genetic make-up and the environment. Key risk factors are inhaled substances that provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways.

About the CAPTAIN Study

CAPTAIN (Clinical study of Asthma Patients receiving Triple therapy through A single INhaler) was a randomised, double-blind, active controlled, six-arm parallel group, global multicentre study evaluating FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg, 200/62.5/25 mcg, 100/31.25/25 mcg, and 200/31.25/25 mcg) versus FF/VI (100/25 mcg and 200/25 mcg) given once-daily to patients whose asthma was inadequately controlled despite treatment with ICS/LABA (>250 mcg/day fluticasone propionate, or equivalent) maintenance asthma medication.

About Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI) in the US

FF/UMEC/VI is a combination of three molecules in a single inhaler that only needs to be taken in a single inhalation, once a day. It contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist; and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, delivered in GSK’s Ellipta dry powder inhaler.

FF/UMEC/VI was approved in the US under the brand name Trelegy Ellipta in September 2017 for the long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. Trelegy Ellipta was approved in the US on 9 September 2020 for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. Trelegy Ellipta is not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm.

US Prescribing Information for Trelegy Ellipta.

Important Safety Information (ISI) for Trelegy Ellipta

The following ISI is based on the Highlights section of the US Prescribing Information for Trelegy Ellipta. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information.

Trelegy Ellipta is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.

Trelegy Ellipta is contraindicated in primary treatment of status asthmaticus or acute episodes of asthma requiring intensive measures and in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any of the ingredients.

LABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.

Trelegy Ellipta should not be initiated in patients experiencing episodes of acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use Trelegy Ellipta to treat acute symptoms

Trelegy Ellipta should not be used in combination with other medicines containing LABA because of risk of overdose.

Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx has occurred in patients treated with fluticasone furoate, a component of Trelegy Ellipta. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk.

There is an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD taking Trelegy Ellipta. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia.

Patients who use corticosteroids are at risk for potential worsening of infections (e.g. existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex). Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients.

There is a risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to Trelegy Ellipta.

Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage of Trelegy Ellipta in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue Trelegy Ellipta slowly.

If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Trelegy Ellipta and institute alternative therapy.

Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of TRELEGY. Discontinue TRELEGY if such reactions occur.

Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Assess patients for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter after prescribing Trelegy Ellipta.

Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use TRELEGY ELLIPTA long term. Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.

Worsening of urinary retention may occur in patients taking Trelegy Ellipta. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.

Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.

Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia in patients taking Trelegy Ellipta.

Orally inhaled corticosteroids may reduce growth velocity in children and adolescents.  Trelegy Ellipta is not indicated for use in children and adolescents.

COPD: The most common adverse reactions reported for Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 mcg (incidence ≥1%) are upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, oral candidiasis, headache, back pain, arthralgia, influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, dysgeusia, constipation, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, cough, and dysphonia.

Asthma: The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, viral respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, rhinitis, influenza, headache, and back pain.

 The study resulted in meeting its 1EPs overall hematologic complete response rate. The sBLA is being reviewed under the FDA’s RTOR program and reviewed under Project Orbis
 Darzalex Faspro is approved as the only SC CD38-directed Ab for MM and is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) and Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug delivery technology","Application is based on positive results from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study evaluating the efficacy
and safety of combination therapy with DARZALEX FASPRO™
RARITAN, NJ, September 10, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &
Johnson announced today the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of DARZALEX FASPRO™
(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab, for the
treatment of patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis, a rare and potentially fatal disease for
which there are no currently approved therapies.
1,2 The sBLA is supported by positive results from
the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study, which were presented as a late-breaking abstract at the 25th
European Hematology Association Annual Congress in June. ANDROMEDA evaluated subcutaneous
daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd)

compared to VCd alone and met its primary endpoint of overall hematologic complete response
rate.
“We are excited about the potential of helping patients with AL amyloidosis who currently have no
FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of their disease,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice
President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research &
Development, LLC. “The results from the Phase 3 ANDROMEDA study also provide preliminary
evidence of DARZALEX FASPRO’s potential to modify the organ damage that is a hallmark of this
serious disease with high unmet needs and we look forward to collaborating with the agency in the
review of the application.”
The sBLA is being reviewed under the FDA Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, which
allows data for certain applications to be reviewed before the applicant formally submits the
complete application. The RTOR program aims to explore a more efficient review process to help
ensure treatments are available as soon as possible for patients. Selection into the RTOR program
does not guarantee or influence approvability of the supplemental application.
The submission is also being reviewed under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center
of Excellence, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology

AL amyloidosis is a life-threatening disorder that occurs when plasma cells in the bone marrow
produce abnormal light chains, that form amyloid deposits, which build up in vital organs and
eventually cause organ deterioration.1,2 The disease can affect different organs in different people,
but the most frequently affected organs are the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, GI tract and nervous
system.
4 Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is often delayed because patients present with non-specific
symptoms that mimic other conditions, resulting in a poor prognosis.
5 There are currently no FDAapproved therapies to treat this devastating disease. While AL amyloidosis is the most common
type of amyloidosis, it remains a rare disease with an estimated 30,000 to 45,000 people living
with the disease in the U.S. and Europe.6 Each year, an estimated 4,500 people develop AL
amyloidosis in the U.S. alone.

About the ANDROMEDA Study
7
ANDROMEDA (NCT03201965) is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, open-label study investigating
the safety and efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with bortezomib,
3
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd), compared to VCd alone, for the treatment of
patients with newly diagnosed light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The study includes 388 patients with
newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with measurable hematologic disease and one or more organs
affected. The primary endpoint is overall complete hematologic response rate by intent-to-treat
(ITT). Secondary endpoints include major organ deterioration progression-free survival, event-free
survival, organ response rate, overall survival, and time to hematologic response, among others.
About DARZALEX FASPRO™
Janssen is committed to exploring the potential of DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and
hyaluronidase-fihj) for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) across the spectrum of the disease.
In August 2012, Janssen entered into an exclusive global license and development agreement with
Genmab A/S to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX®.
8
In 2020, DARZALEX
FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase human-fihj) was approved as the only subcutaneous
CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with MM.
9 DARZALEX FASPRO™ is coformulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug
delivery technology.
CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of
the stage of disease.4 Daratumumab binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma
cell death.5 DARZALEX FASPRO™ may also have an effect on normal cells.10 Data across seven
Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings, have shown that daratumumabbased regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall
survival.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 Additional studies are underway to assess the efficacy and safety of
DARZALEX FASPRO™ in the treatment of other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases
in which CD38 is expressed, including smoldering myeloma and in AL amyloidosis.19,20

DARZALEX FASPRO™ IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
CONTRAINDICATIONS
DARZALEX FASPRO™ is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to
daratumumab, hyaluronidase or any of the components of the formulation.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
4
Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions
Both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and
local injection-site reactions can occur with DARZALEX FASPRO™.
Systemic Reactions
In a pooled safety population of 490 patients who received DARZALEX FASPRO™ as monotherapy or
in combination, 11% of patients experienced a systemic administration-related reaction (Grade 2:
3.9%, Grade 3: 1.4%). Systemic administration-related reactions occurred in 10% of patients with
the first injection, 0.2% with the second injection, and cumulatively 0.8% with subsequent injections.
The median time to onset was 3.7 hours (range: 9 minutes to 3.5 days). Of the 84 systemic
administration-related reactions that occurred in 52 patients, 73 (87%) occurred on the day of
DARZALEX FASPRO™ administration. Delayed systemic administration-related reactions have
occurred in less than 1% of the patients.
Severe reactions included hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension and tachycardia. Other signs and
symptoms of systemic administration-related reactions may include respiratory symptoms, such as
bronchospasm, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing, as well as
anaphylactic reaction, pyrexia, chest pain, pruritis, chills, vomiting, nausea, and hypotension.
Pre-medicate patients with histamine-1 receptor antagonist, acetaminophen and corticosteroids.
Monitor patients for systemic administration-related reactions, especially following the first and
second injections. For anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) administration-related
reactions, immediately and permanently discontinue DARZALEX FASPRO™. Consider administering
corticosteroids and other medications after the administration of DARZALEX FASPRO™ depending on
dosing regimen and medical history to minimize the risk of delayed (defined as occurring the day
after administration) systemic administration-related reactions.
Local Reactions
In this pooled safety population, injection-site reactions occurred in 8% of patients, including Grade 2
reactions in 0.6%. The most frequent (>1%) injection-site reaction was injection site erythema.
These local reactions occurred a median of 7 minutes (range: 0 minutes to 4.7 days) after starting
administration of DARZALEX FASPRO™. Monitor for local reactions and consider symptomatic
management.
5
Neutropenia
Daratumumab may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood
cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing information for
background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding
DARZALEX FASPRO™ until recovery of neutrophils. In lower body weight patients receiving
DARZALEX FASPRO™, higher rates of Grade 3-4 neutropenia were observed.
Thrombocytopenia
Daratumumab may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete
blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing information
for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX FASPRO™ until recovery of platelets.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPRO™ can cause fetal harm when administered
to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPRO™ may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased
bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with
reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPRO™ and
for 3 months after the last dose.
The combination of DARZALEX FASPRO™ with lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women,
because lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the
lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.
Interference with Serological Testing
Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin
Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist
for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks
detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s
ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted.
Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks
that a patient has received DARZALEX FASPRO™. Type and screen patients prior to starting
DARZALEX FASPRO™.
Interference with Determination of Complete Response
Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum
protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of
6
endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of
disease progression in some DARZALEX FASPRO™-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reaction (≥20%) with DARZALEX FASPRO™ monotherapy is upper
respiratory tract infection.
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with D-VMP are upper respiratory tract infection,
constipation, nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhea, cough, insomnia,
vomiting, and back pain. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with D-Rd are fatigue,
diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, constipation, pyrexia, pneumonia and
dyspnea.
The most common hematology laboratory abnormalities (≥40%) with DARZALEX FASPRO™ are
decreased leukocytes, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, and
decreased hemoglobin.

HORSHAM, Pa., July 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TREMFYA® (guselkumab) for adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a chronic progressive disease characterized by painful joints and skin inflammation.1,2 TREMFYA is the first treatment approved for active PsA that selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-23, a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses associated with the symptoms of PsA. The safety and efficacy of TREMFYA in PsA have been demonstrated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. TREMFYA is administered as a 100 mg subcutaneous injection every eight weeks, following two starter doses at weeks 0 and 4. TREMFYA can be used alone or in combination with a conventional Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug or DMARD (e.g., methotrexate).

The Unmet Needs in PsA
Psoriatic arthritis affects about 1.5 million Americans.3 Studies show that up to 30 percent of the more than eight million Americans living with psoriasis will also develop PsA.4 There is currently no cure for the disease and, despite available treatments, many people living with PsA are still searching for more options that can help alleviate their symptoms and provide some relief.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disease characterized by joint inflammation, enthesitis (inflammation where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the digits of the hands and feet), axial disease (pain in the axial skeleton, primarily in the spine, hips and shoulders) and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.1 The disease commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50 but can develop at any time.5 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease. Without early recognition, diagnosis and treatment, the disease can continue to progress.5

“Psoriatic arthritis is a complex multi-faceted disease and, for many patients, additional biologic options are very much needed,” said Philip J. Measei, M.D., DISCOVER-2 Lead Study Investigator, Director of Rheumatology Research at the Swedish Medical Center/Providence St. Joseph Health and Clinical Professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, WA. “The two Phase 3 pivotal trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of TREMFYA, an IL-23 inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis provided insight into how it can improve joint symptoms. Today’s approval is exciting for both patients and their physicians, as there is now a new approach available to help manage the symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis that patients face day to day.”

Pivotal Data Supporting the TREMFYA Approval
The approval of TREMFYA was based on results from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA administered by subcutaneous injection in adults with active PsA compared to placebo. The results, recently published in The Lancet, showed that a significant percentage of patients treated with TREMFYA reached the studies’ primary endpoint of ACR20a at 24 weeks, with 52 and 64 percent of patients achieving an ACR20 response compared to 22 and 33 percent in patients treated with placebo in DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, respectively.

In addition, treatment with TREMFYA improved patients’ symptoms, which included skin manifestations of psoriasis, physical functioning as measured by the HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disease Index)b and SF-36 Physical Component Summaryc score, and soft tissue (enthesitis and dactylitis). TREMYFA also resulted in improvement in fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-F).d

“At Janssen, we strive to reimagine what is possible in how immune-mediated diseases like active psoriatic arthritis are understood and treated,” said David M. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “TREMFYA is the first and only selective IL-23 inhibitor approved for both active psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as well as the only biologic approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis to have improvement in fatigue as measured by FACIT-F included in the U.S. Prescribing Information. Today’s approval marks an exciting milestone as we follow the science and search for solutions for patients with these complicated diseases.”

The overall safety profile observed in patients with PsA treated with TREMFYA is generally consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis with the addition of bronchitis and neutrophil count decreased.

About the DISCOVER Development Program
DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 were Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of TREMFYA in 1,120 adult patients with active PsA who had inadequate response to standard therapies. In DISCOVER-1, approximately 31 percent of patients had been previously treated with up to two anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) agents whereas in DISCOVER-2 all patients were naïve to biologic therapy. Approximately 58 percent of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use.

The DISCOVER-1 study showed that in patients who received TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks after two starter doses, 52 percent achieved an ACR20 response versus 22 percent treated with placebo (p<0.0001), with a comparable response irrespective of prior TNF exposure. In DISCOVER-2, 64 percent of patients who received TREMFYA every 8 weeks achieved an ACR20 response, versus 33 percent treated with placebo (p<0.0001).

TREMFYA was also shown to relieve patients’ pain in their soft tissue and inflammation in their fingers and toes. In a pooled analysis of DISCOVER-1 and -2 at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks resolved enthesitis in 50 percent of patients, versus 29 percent in patients receiving placebo (p=0.0301). In another pooled analysis at week 24, treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks also resolved dactylitis in 59 percent of patients, versus 42 percent receiving placebo (p=0.0301).

Beyond its impact on improving symptoms of PsA in joints, among patients with psoriatic skin involvement, TREMFYA also resulted in an improvement in the skin manifestations of psoriasis in patients with PsA.

“Finding the right psoriatic arthritis treatment can be hard. Individuals living with this complex disease are often left searching for answers, so it’s important for patients to understand their options and to work closely with their doctor on a treatment plan,” said Stacie Bell, Ph.D., Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, National Psoriasis Foundation. “Approval of new treatments for psoriatic arthritis is welcome news for this community and offers physicians and patients more options in their fight to manage this chronic disease.”

Administration and Access for TREMFYA
Patients may self-inject with the TREMFYA One-Press injector after physician approval and proper training. The TREMFYA One-Press is a single-dose, patient-controlled injector that has received the Arthritis Foundation’s Ease of Use Commendation after being tested in patients with PsA.

Janssen will work closely with payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to help ensure TREMFYA is broadly accessible and affordable for patients living with PsA.

Janssen CarePath offers a comprehensive support program that helps patients get started on TREMFYA and stay on track. Janssen CarePath provides information on insurance coverage, potential out-of-pocket costs and treatment support, and identifies options that may help make treatment more affordable, including the Janssen CarePath Savings Program for commercially insured patients who are eligible. TREMFYA BiocoordiNATION offers resources to bio-coordinators within rheumatology and dermatology practices who help patients navigate the healthcare system so that they can start and stay on their prescribed therapy.

FOSTER CITY, Calif. & MORRIS PLAINS, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Immunomedics (Nasdaq: IMMU) announced today that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Gilead will acquire Immunomedics for $88.00 per share in cash. The transaction, which values Immunomedics at approximately $21 billion, was unanimously approved by both the Gilead and Immunomedics Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2020.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200913005051/en/

The agreement will provide Gilead with TrodelvyTM (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy), a first-in-class Trop-2 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Immunomedics plans to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) to support full approval of Trodelvy in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2020. Immunomedics is also on track to file for regulatory approval in Europe in the first half of 2021.

In the Phase 3 ASCENT study, which was halted early due to efficacy based on the unanimous recommendation of the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee, Trodelvy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in previously treated patients with advanced mTNBC. Detailed results from this study are expected to be presented at the upcoming European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020.

Beyond mTNBC, Trodelvy is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 3 trial in third line HR+/HER2- breast cancer and a registrational Phase 2 study in bladder cancer. Additional ongoing studies are evaluating the potential of Trodelvy as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumor types. Trodelvy is being studied as both a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other non-immuno-oncology products by Immunomedics and independent investigators. Additional clinical data for Trodelvy in bladder cancer and other solid tumors will also be presented at ESMO this coming week.

“This acquisition represents significant progress in Gilead’s work to build a strong and diverse oncology portfolio. Trodelvy is an approved, transformational medicine for a form of cancer that is particularly challenging to treat. We will now continue to explore its potential to treat many other types of cancer, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other treatments,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to welcoming the talented Immunomedics team to Gilead so we can continue to advance this important new medicine for the benefit of patients with cancer worldwide.”

“We are very pleased that Gilead recognized the value of Trodelvy – both for the important role it has already begun to play for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for its potential to help many other patients with cancer in the future,” said Behzad Aghazadeh, PhD, Executive Chairman of Immunomedics. “We are excited for the opportunities ahead of us as we join with Gilead to advance our shared mission in defeating cancer. By working with Gilead, we have the opportunity to accelerate our progress and improve care for patients in need of new therapies.”

Compelling Strategic Benefits

Rapidly Expanding Trodelvy’s Benefit for Patients Globally: After closing Gilead intends to initiate numerous additional mid- and late-stage studies in the near term to determine which patients will benefit from Trodelvy as both a monotherapy or in combination with other products. Gilead brings commercial, medical, regulatory and manufacturing expertise, which will help rapidly advance Trodelvy through development and reach additional patients. Gilead will also bring to Immunomedics an established infrastructure and operations in Europe and Japan to support the launch of Trodelvy in those regions, pending approval. After closing, Gilead will retain global rights to Trodelvy outside of greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries.
Trodelvy is Foundational to Gilead’s Oncology Franchise: Trodelvy will bring to Gilead a cornerstone product that broadens and deepens the company’s solid tumor pipeline, building on current marketed products and late-stage clinical candidates for patients with hematological malignancies at Kite and Gilead, including Yescarta®, Tecartus® and magrolimab.Trodelvy is approved as a third-line treatment for mTNBC and has shown promise for earlier stages of the disease. TNBC represents approximately 15 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases and is generally considered the most aggressive form of breast cancer. HR+/HER2- breast cancer accounts for more than 70 percent of all breast cancers.
Accelerates Gilead’s Revenue and EPS Growth: Trodelvy was launched in May of 2020 and has significant commercial potential in mTNBC and other solid tumors. In addition to immediately accelerating Gilead’s revenue growth, the acquisition of Immunomedics is expected to be neutral to accretive to Gilead’s non-GAAP EPS in 2023 and significantly accretive thereafter.
Transaction Terms and Financing

Under the terms of the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Immunomedics’ common stock. The $88.00 per share acquisition price represents a 108 percent premium to Immunomedics’ closing price on September 11, 2020. Following successful completion of the tender offer, Gilead will acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the offer through a second step merger at the same price as the tender offer.

The consummation of the tender offer is subject to various conditions, including a minimum tender of at least a majority of outstanding Immunomedics shares, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions.

The tender offer is not subject to a financing condition and will be funded through approximately $15 billion in cash on hand, as well as approximately $6 billion in newly issued debt. Gilead expects to retain an investment grade credit rating following this transaction and this agreement does not alter Gilead’s stated capital allocation strategy or its commitment to maintain and grow its dividend over time.

Lazard and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as financial advisors to Gilead. Centerview Partners LLC and BofA Securities are acting as financial advisors to Immunomedics. Cowen & Company, LLC also provided advice to Immunomedics.

Clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, have resumed in the UK following confirmation by the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to do so.

On 6 September, the standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials to allow review of safety data by independent committees, and international regulators. The UK committee has concluded its investigations and recommended to the MHRA that trials in the UK are safe to resume.

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, as the trial sponsor, cannot disclose further medical information. All trial investigators and participants will be updated with the relevant information and this will be disclosed on global clinical registries, according to the clinical trial and regulatory standards.

AstraZeneca is committed to the safety of trial participants and the highest standards of conduct in clinical trials. The Company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic.

AZD1222
AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

48439,Sanofi's Dupixent Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Eosinophilic Esophagitis,FDA grants Dupixent (dupilumab) Breakthrough Therapy designation for eosinophilic esophagitis,"The BT designation is based on Part A of P-III study assessing Dupixent (300mg) in 81 patients aged ≥12yrs. with EoE for 24wks.
 The Part A of P-III study met its co-1EPs and 2EPs i.e. reduction in symptoms, esophageal inflammation, abnormal endoscopic findings in the esophagus and has demonstrated safety results consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications
 The P-III study is ongoing with additional patients enrolling in Part B as well as patients continuing in a 28wks. extended active treatment period (Part C) after completing either Part A or B. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to show positive P-III results in patients aged ≥12yrs. with EoE and has received the US FDA’s ODD in 2017","Designation based on positive results from Part A of pivotal Phase 3 trial
Dupixent is the first and only biologic to show positive and clinically-meaningful Phase 3 results in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for this chronic type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impacts patients’ ability to swallow and eat
Designation supports Dupixent’s potential in another disease driven by type 2 inflammation
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., September 14, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The designation for this investigational use is based on positive results from Part A of a Phase 3 trial in patients with EoE.

There are currently no FDA-approved medicines for EoE, a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. Over time, excessive type 2 inflammation causes scarring and narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. If left untreated, EoE can affect a patient’s ability to eat and cause food to become stuck after being swallowed (food impaction), which can lead to a medical emergency.

In the U.S. alone, there are approximately 160,000 patients with EoE who are currently being treated with various unapproved therapies or diet modification. Of these patients, approximately 50,000 have failed multiple treatments.

Sanofi and Regeneron previously reported positive results from Part A of the pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent in patients 12 years and older with EoE. Part A of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 81 patients met both of its co-primary endpoints, as well as all key secondary endpoints. Patients treated weekly with Dupixent 300 mg over a 24-week treatment period experienced a reduction in symptoms, esophageal inflammation and abnormal endoscopic findings in the esophagus.

Part A of the trial also demonstrated  safety results consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The EoE trial is ongoing, with additional patients enrolling in Part B as well as patients continuing in a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C) after completing either Part A or Part B.

Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs in the U.S. that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Drugs qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement on  clinically significant endpoints over available therapies, or over placebo if there are no available therapies. In 2017, Dupixent also was granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE. This is given to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.

The potential use of Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy for this indication have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About Dupixent

Dupixent is approved in the U.S. to treat patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies; for use with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in patients aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. In adolescents 12 years of age or older, it is recommended that Dupixent be administered by or under the supervision of an adult. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver.

Outside of the U.S., Dupixent is approved for specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma in a number of other countries around the world, including the EU and Japan. Dupixent is also approved in the EU and Japan to treat certain adults with severe CRSwNP.

Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in asthma, CRSwNP and atopic dermatitis.

Dupilumab Development Program

To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are investigational, and the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in these conditions have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

Novartis actively progressing full clinical development program of Beovu, with studies across wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy
Basel, September 14, 2020 — Novartis today reported the first interpretable results of the Phase III KITE study, assessing the efficacy and safety of Beovu® (brolucizumab) 6 mg in diabetic macular edema (DME). The trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating non-inferiority for Beovu versus aflibercept 2 mg in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at year one (week 52)1.

In a secondary endpoint, Beovu demonstrated superior improvement versus aflibercept in change of central subfield thickness (CST, a key indicator of fluid in the retina) over the period of week 40 through week 521. More than half of patients in the Beovu arm were maintained on a three-month dosing interval through year one, following the loading phase. All aflibercept patients were on a two-month dosing interval after the loading phase1. In KITE, Beovu demonstrated an overall well-tolerated safety profile comparable to aflibercept1. In addition, the rate of intraocular inflammation was equivalent between Beovu and aflibercept1.

“Living with DME has significant impact on patients’ lives and frequent treatment injections are needed to control the increased fluid in the eye,” said Dirk Sauer, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology. “This data confirms our strong belief in Beovu as a potential therapy for DME patients, and if approved, will provide patients with a new treatment option to control their disease through better resolution of retinal fluid and CST reductions.”

The KITE pivotal trial is an ongoing two-year study that enrolled 360 patients with DME across 80 centers in 23 countries1. The data from KITE will be submitted for presentation at medical congresses and for peer-review publication. Novartis is currently conducting a second study in DME, KESTREL2, and anticipates results later in the year, when Novartis will assess next steps with health authorities.

Novartis is actively progressing studies across wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), DME, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The favorable benefit-risk of the Beovu development program was supported by a company-requested review of ongoing studies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Novartis has a comprehensive program of work underway to help support retina specialists with the latest data and understanding they need to make appropriate treatment decisions for their wet AMD patients. Beovu is currently approved in over 40 countries for the treatment of wet AMD.

About Diabetic Macular Edema
DME is the leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes and affects 21 million people across the world, including 12% of people with type 1 diabetes and 28% of those with type 2 diabetes3,4.

Consistently high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage small blood vessels in the eye, causing them to leak fluid5. The resulting accumulation of fluid (known as edema) in the macula can lead to vision loss6. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision6.

Early symptoms of DME include blurry or wavy central vision and distorted color perception, although the disease can also progress without symptoms at early stages5,6.

About Beovu (brolucizumab)
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is approved in more than 40 countries, including in the US7, EU8, UK8, Japan9, Canada10 and Australia11, for the treatment of wet AMD. Additional trials are currently ongoing which study the effects of brolucizumab in patients with AMD, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Brolucizumab is the most clinically advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv)12-14. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics14-16.

The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms15. Beovu is engineered to deliver the highest concentration of drug, providing more active binding agents12-14. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction15-17. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema18. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability18.

Boehringer Ingelheim will receive exclusive global rights to CT-155; Click Therapeutics will receive an upfront payment, development funding, and is eligible to receive additional clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for a total deal value to Click Therapeutics of over $500 million, plus tiered royalties
Ingelheim, Germany and New York, New York, 11 September 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim and Click Therapeutics today announced they have entered into a collaboration for the development and commercialization of a prescription-based digital therapeutic. It will utilize cognitive and neurobehavioral mechanisms delivered through Click’s proprietary engagement platform with the goal of reducing cognitive deficits and impaired social functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Together the two companies will join their expertise to develop a novel mobile application, CT-155, which combines multiple clinically validated therapeutic interventions to help schizophrenia patients modify their behavior to achieve positive clinical outcomes alone and in combination with pharmaceutical therapy options. The partnership aims to provide better tools and resources to those living with schizophrenia, where there remains a huge unmet need due to lack of access to psychosocial intervention therapies.

“At Boehringer Ingelheim we believe that digital technologies can offer exciting new ways to help patients in need. Therefore, we are pleased to partner with Click Therapeutics on the advancement of a prescription-based digital therapeutic, which will hopefully provide better treatment for patients with schizophrenia,” said Jan Stefan Scheld, M.D., Corporate Senior Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head CNS, Retinopathies & Emerging Areas, Boehringer Ingelheim. “CT-155 is an excellent addition to our CNS pipeline portfolio; it reflects our patient centric approach and translates evidence showing how behavioral modification can induce positive neuronal changes into a widely accessible solution. Further it has the potential to be prescribed together with Boehringer Ingelheim’s schizophrenia pipeline compounds possibly enhancing the benefit of pharmacotherapy for patients,” added Cornelia Dorner-Ciossek, Ph.D., Director CNS Diseases Research at Boehringer Ingelheim.

Schizophrenia is one of the 15 leading causes of disability worldwide, with approximately half of all patients exhibiting co-occurring mental and/or behavioral health disorders.1 Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that alters a person’s perception of reality and impacts how they think, feel, and behave, and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia can remain functionally impaired due to insufficiently treated negative symptoms, including cognitive deficits and limited social functioning.2 Treatment guidelines recommend tailored psychosocial intervention therapies, however, access to these interventions is limited.2,3 Providing a novel, digital therapeutic option has the potential to significantly increase patient access to treatment and positively impact their quality of life.

“Partnering with Boehringer Ingelheim allows us to leverage their considerable experience in the clinical development and global commercialization of new treatment options for neuropsychiatric diseases to improve the efficacy and reach of our digital therapeutic software,” said David Benshoof Klein, CEO, Click Therapeutics. “We look forward to evaluating CT-155 in a pivotal clinical study, working together with Boehringer Ingelheim to achieve FDA and international regulatory authorization and to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of this prescription-based digital therapeutic software alone and in combination with traditional pharmaceutical treatments.”

Boehringer Ingelheim recognizes the importance of finding new solutions for people living with neuropsychiatric disorders. As part of its innovative CNS research program, Boehringer Ingelheim has developed and applied new ways to study the brain pathophysiology and to identify dysfunctions in the brain’s neuronal pathways that may be contributing to the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Combining digital innovations that are based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy with pharmacological solutions that also address symptoms at the root cause is key to making progress in clinical trials and improving the lives of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The partnership announced today provides both companies with the opportunity to further establish digital therapeutics as a meaningful new treatment category for patients and providers.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Click Therapeutics will be primarily responsible for research and development activities, and will support Boehringer Ingelheim as it undertakes worldwide commercialization activities.

Click Therapeutics will receive under the terms of the partnership agreement an upfront payment and funding for research and development activities as well as clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones representing a total deal value of over USD 500 million. Additionally, Click Therapeutics will receive tiered royalties on annual net sales of CT-155 worldwide.

About Ladiratuzumab Vedotin

Ladiratuzumab vedotin is a novel investigational ADC targeted to LIV-1. Most metastatic breast cancers express LIV-1, which also has been detected in several other cancers, including lung, head and neck, esophageal and gastric. Ladiratuzumab vedotin utilizes Seattle Genetics’ proprietary ADC technology and consists of a LIV-1-targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a potent microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) by a protease-cleavable linker. This novel ADC is designed to bind to LIV-1 on cancer cells and release the cell-killing agent into target cells upon internalization. Ladiratuzumab vedotin may also cause antitumor activity through other mechanisms, including activation of an immune response by induction of immunogenic cell death.

About TUKYSA (tucatinib)

TUKYSA is an oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of HER2, a protein that contributes to cancer cell growth. TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2020 for adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. In addition, TUKYSA received approval in Canada, Singapore, Australia and Switzerland under the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. A marketing application is under review in the European Union.

TUKYSA is being evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials and additional studies are planned. Current trials include the following:

HER2CLIMB-02: a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial evaluating TUKYSA in combination with T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine; Kadcyla®) versus T-DM1 in first- and second-line metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
CompassHER2 RD: a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial of TUKYSA in combination with T-DM1 versus T-DM1 in the adjuvant breast cancer setting for patients at high risk of relapse.
MOUNTAINEER: a pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in metastatic HER2-positive colorectal cancer.
MOUNTAINEER-02: a randomized phase 2/3 trial evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel versus ramucirumab and paclitaxel in second-line metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEC).
Gastrointestinal cancers: a phase 1 trial evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in metastatic HER2-positive colorectal, gastric/ gastroesophageal junction and gallbladder cancers.

TUKYSA Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Diarrhea – TUKYSA can cause severe diarrhea including dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. In HER2CLIMB, 81% of patients who received TUKYSA experienced diarrhea, including 12% with Grade 3 diarrhea and 0.5% with Grade 4 diarrhea. Both patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhea subsequently died, with diarrhea as a contributor to death. The median time to onset of the first episode of diarrhea was 12 days and the median time to resolution was 8 days. Diarrhea led to dose reductions of TUKYSA in 6% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1% of patients. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheal treatment was not required on HER2CLIMB.
If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Based on the severity of the diarrhea, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.

Hepatotoxicity – TUKYSA can cause severe hepatotoxicity. In HER2CLIMB, 8% of patients who received TUKYSA had an ALT increase >5 × ULN, 5% had an AST increase >5 × ULN, and 1.5% had a bilirubin increase >3 × ULN (Grade ≥3). Hepatotoxicity led to dose reduction of TUKYSA in 8% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to starting TUKYSA, every 3 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of hepatoxicity, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity – TUKYSA can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential, and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during TUKYSA treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and seizure (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received TUKYSA including sudden death, sepsis, dehydration, and cardiogenic shock.

Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥1% of patients were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction in 21% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥2% of patients were hepatotoxicity (8%) and diarrhea (6%).

The most common adverse reactions in patients who received TUKYSA (≥20%) were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash.

Lab Abnormalities

In HER2CLIMB, Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥5% of patients who received TUKYSA were: decreased phosphate, increased ALT, decreased potassium, and increased AST. The mean increase in serum creatinine was 32% within the first 21 days of treatment with TUKYSA. The serum creatinine increases persisted throughout treatment and were reversible upon treatment completion. Consider alternative markers of renal function if persistent elevations in serum creatinine are observed.

Drug Interactions

Strong CYP3A or Moderate CYP2C8 Inducers: Concomitant use may decrease TUKYSA activity. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA.
Strong or Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor may increase the risk of TUKYSA toxicity; avoid concomitant use. Increase monitoring for TUKYSA toxicity with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors.
CYP3A Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. If concomitant use is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage.
P-gp Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a P-gp substrate. Consider reducing the dosage of P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicity.
Use in Specific Populations

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TUKYSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Renal Impairment: Use of TUKYSA in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), because capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the dose of TUKYSA for patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.

Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, despite being one of the most preventable conditions. AFib, an irregular heart rhythm that increases the risk of serious complications like stroke, can be particularly difficult to detect, as episodes can sometimes show no symptoms. Some studies suggest that as many as 25 percent of people who have an AFib-related stroke find out they have AFib only after a stroke has occurred.4

“Helping people understand and manage their heart health has always been a priority for Fitbit, and our new ECG app is designed for those users who want to assess themselves in the moment and review the reading later with their doctor,” said Eric Friedman, Fitbit co-founder and CTO. “Early detection of AFib is critical, and I’m incredibly excited that we are making these innovations accessible to people around the world to help them improve their heart health, prevent more serious conditions and potentially save lives.”

As part of the submission process to regulatory agencies, Fitbit conducted a multi-site clinical trial in regions across the U.S. The study evaluated our algorithm’s ability to accurately detect AFib from normal sinus rhythm and to generate an ECG trace, or recording of a heart’s electrical rhythm, that is qualitatively similar to a Lead I ECG. The study showed that the algorithm exceeded target performance, demonstrating the ability to detect 98.7% of AFib cases (sensitivity) and was 100% accurate in identifying study participants with normal sinus rhythm (specificity).

Fitbit’s new on-device compatible ECG app helps analyze the heart’s rhythm for signs of AFib. ECG is a measurement of the electrical activity of the heart, and the Fitbit ECG App is a simple way people can take an on-the-spot reading of their heart rhythm at any time, including whenever they notice any unusual cardiac symptoms.

“Physicians are often flying blind as to the day-to-day lives of our patients in between office visits. I’ve long believed in the potential for wearable devices to help us stay better connected, and use real-world, individual data to deliver more informed, personalized care,” said Dr. Venkatesh Raman, interventional cardiologist at MedStar Georgetown Hospital and Principal Investigator for the U.S. clinical study on Fitbit’s ECG App. “Given the toll that AFib continues to take on individuals and families around the world, I’m very enthusiastic about the potential of this tool to help people detect possible AFib, a clinically important rhythm abnormality, even after they leave the physician’s office.”

Fitbit Sense is the company’s first device compatible with an ECG app that enables users to take a spot check reading of their heart that can be analyzed for the heart rhythm irregularity AFib. Users simply hold their fingers to the stainless steel ring on the watch while being still for 30 seconds to get a reading that can be downloaded and shared with a doctor. Fitbit Sense is the company’s most advanced health smartwatch, with the world’s first electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor on a smartwatch to help manage stress, and an on-wrist skin temperature sensor5, all powered by 6+ days of battery life6 to help users take control of their health and wellbeing during this unprecedented time.

Broader Commitment to Heart Health

The new ECG app is part of Fitbit’s broader approach to heart health innovation. Fitbit pioneered the use of heart rate tracking on the wrist with its PurePulse technology in 2014, which uses photoplethysmography (or PPG) to monitor the tiny blood volume fluctuations in the wrist as the heart beats, and we continue to develop innovative tools that help people better understand and manage their heart health.

Both long-term heart rhythm assessment (PPG) and spot check (ECG) technology have important roles to play and Fitbit aims to provide both options to users based on their individual needs. Long-term heart rhythm assessment could give our users the ability to identify asymptomatic AFib that could otherwise go undetected, while a spot check approach with new Fitbit ECG App can help those who want to screen themselves for possible AFib and record an ECG trace they can review with their healthcare provider.

In May 2020, the Fitbit Heart Studylaunched to validate the use of Fitbit’s PPG technology to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythm suggestive of AFib. In just over four months, the Fitbit Heart Study has enrolled more than 400,000 participants.7 Fitbit users in the United States interested in participating can visit the study website or open the Fitbit app to find the Fitbit Heart Study on the Discover tab under Assessments & Reports. The results of the study will be used to support Fitbit’s regulatory submissions globally for its long-term heart rhythm assessment feature.

Continuing the legacy of heart health innovation, Fitbit released PurePulse 2.0 in August 2020, delivering the company’s most advanced heart rate technology yet, using an all-new multi-path heart rate sensor and improved algorithm. This enhanced technology provides users with on-device and in-app notifications if their heart rate goes above or below their set heart rate threshold.8 Users who receive a notification can also take a survey in the Fitbit app to share with their doctor.

 The study met its EPs i.e. it demonstrated 1day reduction in median recovery time for the overall patient population and met its 2EPs i.e. comparing patient outcomes at Day 15 using an ordinal 8-point scale ranging from fully recovered to death
 Lilly plans to discuss the potential of baricitinib for the US FDA’s EUA and to explore similar measures with other regulatory bodies. Additionally, Lilly will review the ACTT-2 data with NIAID and assess any impact on P-III COV-BARRIER study, initiated in June to assess baricitinib vs background therapy in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in the US, EU, Asia, and Latin America","Eli Lilly and Incyte reported Monday that the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor Olumiant (baricitinib) in combination with Gilead Sciences’ Veklury (remdesivir) met the primary endpoint of the ACTT 2 study by significantly reducing the time to recovery compared to Veklury alone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Eli Lilly said that based on the results, it plans to discuss the potential for emergency-use authorisation (EUA) of Olumiant with the FDA, as well as similar measures with other regulatory bodies.

The study, which was launched in May by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), included 1,034 patients and evaluated a 4-mg oral dose of Olumiant plus intravenous Veklury, versus Veklury alone, in hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who show signs of lung involvement, such as the need for supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, or having abnormal chest X-rays. The primary endpoint was time to recovery, with recovery defined as the patient no longer being hospitalized at day 29, or being well enough for discharge because they either do not need supplemental oxygen anymore or ongoing medical care in hospital.

One-day faster recovery
Initial results demonstrated that adding Olumiant to Veklury cut the median time to recovery by roughly one day, compared to Veklury alone, an improvement that was statistically significant. Previously announced results from the NIAID-led ACTT trial had shown that Veklury led to a 31% faster time to recovery in hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19, shaving four days off recovery times when compared to placebo. Gilead’s antiviral drug was awarded an EUA shortly after those findings were made public.

Meanwhile, Eli Lilly and Incyte noted that ACTT 2 also met a key secondary endpoint comparing patient outcomes at day 15 using an ordinal eight-point scale ranging from fully recovered to death. They noted that more analyses are under way, including a closer look at mortality and safety data.

“These data allow us to better understand Olumiant’s role in potentially improving outcomes for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to continuing this research alongside our other initiatives to combat COVID-19,” remarked Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. The drugmaker indicated that it plans to assess any impact of the ACTT 2 results on the placebo-controlled phase 3 COV-BARRIER trial that it launched in June to test Olumiant against background therapy in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Participants in this ongoing study have at least one elevated marker of inflammation, but do not need invasive mechanical ventilation at study entry.

The 2-mg dose of Olumiant is already approved in the US and several other countries as a treatment for adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. If authorized for use in COVID-19, Eli Lilly said it will propose that Olumiant be available through commercial channels, but that it will continue to create adequate supply for rheumatoid arthritis patients and also ensure the drug remains available in countries where it is approved.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lilly-4.jpg,Clinical Trials,Eli Lilly | Incyte,Olumiant | Veklury,COVID-19 | clinical trials | Eli Lilly|  Gilead|Hospitalized Patients|Incyte|Olumiant|Recovery|Reduce Time|Veklury,publish,15/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/lilly-incytes-olumiant-cuts-recovery-time-when-added-to-veklury-in-hospitalized-covid-19-patients/,https://pharmashots.com/48479/eli-lilly-and-incytes-olumiant-gileads-veklury-reduce-time-to-recovery-in-hospitalized-patients-with-covid-19/

September 14, 2020 06:30 ET | Source: SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc.
STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer, today announced that the company has entered into a clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) to evaluate SpringWorks Therapeutics’ investigational gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), nirogacestat, in combination with Janssen’s bispecific antibody targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD3, teclistamab, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Gamma secretase inhibition prevents the cleavage and shedding of BCMA from the surface of myeloma cells. In preclinical models, nirogacestat has been shown to increase the cell surface density of BCMA and reduce levels of soluble BCMA, which may enhance the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies, including CD3 bispecific antibodies.

“We are delighted to enter into this collaboration with Janssen to study nirogacestat in combination with teclistamab,” said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks Therapeutics. “We now have three collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities, including with an antibody-drug conjugate, an allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy and now a bispecific antibody. This collaboration is an important step in continuing to advance our goal of developing nirogacestat as a best-in-class BCMA potentiator.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Janssen will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and will assume all costs associated with the study, other than expenses related to the manufacturing of nirogacestat. SpringWorks Therapeutics will also form a joint oversight committee with Janssen. Pending discussions with regulators, the study is anticipated to commence by early 2021.

In addition to its ongoing clinical collaborations with BCMA-directed therapies, SpringWorks is also currently conducting a global Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the DeFi Trial) to evaluate nirogacestat in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.

About Nirogacestat
Nirogacestat is an investigational, oral, selective, small molecule, gamma secretase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development for desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft-tissue tumors. Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to desmoid tumor growth.

In addition, gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is pursuing a combination therapy approach to evaluate nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator across modalities by collaborating with industry leaders. In addition to today’s announcement, SpringWorks has entered into two other clinical collaborations to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with GlaxoSmithKline’s BCMA antibody-drug conjugate BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) and with Allogene’s allogeneic BCMA CAR-T cell therapy ALLO-715.

Nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors (June 2018) and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (September 2019). The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis (November 2018 and August 2019).

The update includes the additional characterization of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation1
Novartis has established a multidisciplinary panel of internal experts collaborating with external advisors to examine the root cause, potential risk factors and mitigation of these adverse events
Novartis is confident that Beovu continues to represent an important treatment option for patients with wet AMD, with an overall favorable benefit/risk profile 
Basel, September 14, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), has approved an update to the Beovu® (brolucizumab) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to include additional information regarding retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion1. Typically, these events occurred in the presence of intraocular inflammation. This approval follows Novartis’ announcement that it would pursue worldwide label updates after a review and further characterization of post-marketing safety events reported to Novartis.

The update to the EU label includes the addition of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation under “Special warnings and precautions for use” (section 4.4) and “Undesirable effect” (section 4.8). The label notes that patients developing these events should discontinue treatment and the events should be promptly managed1.

“This label update is one of the many efforts Novartis is taking to help physicians make informed decisions,” said Marcia Kayath, Global Head of Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Novartis is committed to fully understanding and transparently communicating the safety profile of Beovu. To this purpose, we have established a coalition, which is a fully dedicated internal team collaborating with top global experts to examine the root cause, risk factors, mitigation and potential treatment recommendations.”

The label update is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein1. Beovu is now approved for the treatment of wet AMD in more than 40 countries, including in the US2, EU1, UK1, Japan3, Canada4 and Australia5.

About Beovu (brolucizumab)
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is the most clinically advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv)6-8. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics8-10.

The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms9. Beovu is engineered to deliver a high concentration of drug, thus providing more active binding agents6-8. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction9-11. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema12. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability12.

Beovu is approved in more than 40 countries, including in the US2, EU1, UK1, Japan3, Canada4 and Australia5, based on the results of the HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials.

About the HAWK and HARRIER studies
With more than 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide, HAWK (NCT02307682) and HARRIER (NCT02434328) are the first global head-to-head trials in patients with wet AMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy of Beovu at week 48 using an innovative q12w/q8w regimen, with a majority of patients on q12w immediately following the loading phase6,7. Both studies are 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies and part of the Phase III clinical development of Beovu6,7. The studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD6,7. The most common adverse events (>=5% of patients) with Beovu were vision blurred, cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous floaters and eye pain6,7.

48504,The US FDA Rejects Mallinckrodt's Terlipressin Due to Doubts in its Risk-Benefit Profile,Mallinckrodt Receives a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Terlipressin for the Treatment of Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1 (HRS-1),"The US FDA has issued CRL to Terlipressin’s NDA for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) and requires more information to support a positive risk-benefit profile for the therapy in HRS-1 patients
 The company is confident with its P-III CONFIRM study assessing the safety and efficacy of terlipressin in patients with HRS-1 for potential use in the US and Canada. On Jul 15, 2020, the FDA’s CRDAC voted to recommend approval of the therapy
 Terlipressin is a potent vasopressin analog selective for V1 receptors being evaluated for HRS-1 in the US and Canada and is approved in multiple countries outside the US","Company remains committed to working with FDA toward an approval for this important potential therapy

Mallinckrodt logo
DUBLIN, Sept. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) seeking approval for the investigational agent terlipressin to treat adults with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1).

The CRL stated that, based on the available data, the agency cannot approve the terlipressin NDA in its current form and requires more information to support a positive risk-benefit profile for terlipressin for patients with HRS-1. HRS-1 is an acute and life-threatening syndrome involving acute kidney failure in people with cirrhosis1 for which there is currently no FDA-approved treatment.2 HRS-1 is estimated to affect between 30,000 and 40,000 Americans annually,3,4 and often is a challenge to effectively diagnose in a timely manner due to its diagnosis of exclusion.5 If left untreated, HRS-1 has a median survival time of approximately two weeks and greater than 80 percent mortality within three months.5,6 U.S. discharge data in a recently published study indicated an in-hospital mortality rate of 34.2% (n=1,133), while an additional 14.4% (n=475) of patients were discharged to hospice.7

“While we are disappointed that the FDA issued a complete response letter for terlipressin, we remain confident in the strength of the data from our Phase 3 CONFIRM study, which is the largest clinical trial ever conducted in this rare condition,” said Steven Romano, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Mallinckrodt. “HRS-1 is a complex disease that affects a critically ill patient population with no approved treatment in the U.S. at present. We are surprised by and disagree with the FDA’s decision and remain committed to pursuing all available options as we continue working with the FDA toward approval of terlipressin in order to help address this difficult and life-threatening syndrome.”

Terlipressin is an investigational agent being evaluated for the treatment of HRS-1 in the U.S., and its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established by the FDA.

Terlipressin is approved in many countries outside the United States, where it has been a standard of care for decades in the treatment of patients with HRS-1.8,9 Terlipressin, together with albumin, is currently the standard of care for HRS-1 in countries where it is available.10

In 2005, terlipressin was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, which provides for expedited review to facilitate development of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need.11 In 2016, Mallinckrodt and the FDA reached agreement on the Phase 3 CONFIRM trial protocol design and data analysis under the agency’s special protocol assessment (SPA) process. A SPA is an advance agreement with the FDA for the acceptability of the clinical design, endpoints and statistical data analyses for a Phase 3 trial before the start of the trial.

On July 15, 2020, the company announced that the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted to recommend approval of its investigational agent terlipressin to treat adults with HRS-1 based, in part, on results from the Phase 3 CONFIRM trial. The CONFIRM trial was the largest-ever prospective study (n=300) conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of terlipressin in patients with HRS-1 for potential use in the U.S. and Canada. Initial results were presented in a late-breaking session at The Liver Meeting® 2019, the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).

About Terlipressin
Terlipressin is a potent vasopressin analogue selective for V1 receptors being investigated for the treatment of HRS-1 in the U.S. and Canada. It is an investigational product in these countries as the safety and efficacy have not been established with, nor has approval been granted by, regulatory authorities in either country. Terlipressin is approved for use outside the U.S. and Canada.

September 14, 2020 08:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time
INGELHEIM, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the results from a 12-week, placebo-controlled Phase II trial, that demonstrated BI 425809 has met its primary endpoint. The data showed improvement in cognition in stable adult patients with schizophrenia.1 Central to many everyday tasks, impairment of cognitive function still constitutes a major burden for patients, and no pharmacological treatments are currently approved for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). These results presented at the 33rd European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) Congress will advance the understanding of how deficits in transmission of signals between nerve cells may contribute to diminishing cognition in people living with schizophrenia.2

The Gly-T1 inhibitor, BI 425809, forms a key component of Boehringer Ingelheim’s Central Nervous System (CNS) research program. The latest trial results, along with an ongoing combination Phase II study of BI 425809 and adjunctive computerized cognitive training, will help determine the direction for BI 425809 in further schizophrenia research.3,4

Prof. W. Wolfgang Fleischhacker, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria: “The outcome of this trial is an important step forward in our understanding of cognition in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairment causes significant challenges for people in their everyday functioning. Patients with schizophrenia struggle with remembering things like birthdays, learning new tasks, concentrating, or making decisions that affect their everyday life. Advancing our understanding of how we might improve these symptoms in schizophrenia is significant for the research community and the patients and families living with this condition.”

The Phase II results of BI 425809 in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia are being further evaluated to assess how they will support the continued research and development for the treatment of schizophrenia.

“The trial results for our investigational compound BI 425809 in schizophrenia are encouraging. This is a positive advancement in our mechanistic knowledge of how excitatory neurotransmissions affect aspects of mental illness, aligning with our systematic neurobiological approach to CNS research,” adds Dr Vikas Mohan Sharma, M.D., head of medicine CNS, Retinopathies & Emerging Areas, Boehringer Ingelheim. “We recognize this is important news for people affected by schizophrenia. We are making progress in developing treatments which will not only reveal important advances in our understanding of schizophrenia but also potentially other neuropsychiatric diseases.”

Cognition is a fundamental aspect of everyday life, including problem solving, memory and attention. When affected, people living with poor cognition can have a reduced mental ability to process information, remember straightforward things or perceive other people’s emotions and expressions. These functions are common to many forms of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and depression. Finding solutions for cognitive impairment is a key area of Boehringer Ingelheim CNS research.

48547,"Merck's Brenzys (etanercept, biosimilar) Receives Health Canada Approval for Multiple Indications","BRENZYS (etanercept injection) now indicated for the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis","Health Canada has approved Brenzys for new indications that include adults & pediatric patients (4-17yrs.) with PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy/ phototherapy, adult patients with PsA, and patients aged 4-17yrs. with JIA
 The clinical efficacy and safety studies conducted in patients with RA demonstrate clinical comparability between Brenzys and the reference product. The extrapolation of these data supports the use of Brenzys in AS
 Brenzys is a biosimilar referencing Enbrel, which is approved for use for PsO, PsA, and JIA in Canada. Brenzys received its first Health Canada approval in 2016 for the mod. to sev. RA in adults and AS and is administered via injection under the skin and should be used under the guidance and supervision of a physician","BRENZYS® is a biosimilar biologic drug authorized based on its similarity to ENBREL®, which is already approved for use in Canada.1
Approximately one million people in Canada live with psoriasis,2 and between 10 and 30% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis.3
KIRKLAND, QC, Sept. 15, 2020 /CNW/ – Merck Canada Inc., an affiliate of Merck & Co., Inc., known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that Health Canada has approved BRENZYS®, a TNF-inhibitor, for four new indications:

Adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy
Pediatric patients ages 4 to 17 years with chronic severe PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy
Reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage of active arthritis and improving physical function in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
Reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients aged 4 to 17 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 4
BRENZYS® is a type of protein called a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blocker that blocks the action of a substance the body makes called TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is made by the body’s immune system.5 People with immune diseases like JIA, PsA and PsO have too much TNF-alpha in their bodies, which can cause inflammation and lead to painful, swollen joints and raise thick, red, scaly patches (“psoriatic skin lesions”) that can appear anywhere on the body.6 It can reduce the amount of TNF in the body to normal levels, helping to treat joint damage and psoriatic skin conditions. 7

An estimated one million Canadians live with psoriasis,8 and between 10 and 30% of these patients will develop psoriatic arthritis.9 Plaque Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that affects the skin and can cause psoriatic skin lesions that can appear anywhere on the body.10 About 80% to 90% of people with psoriasis have plaque psoriasis, the most common type of psoriasis.11 PsA is usually seen in patients with PsO and affects both the joints and the skin.12 JIA is an inflammatory disease that affects the joints in the body and is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16.13 Approximately 10,000 children and teens live with arthritis in Canada.14

“Merck is committed to providing Canadians with more therapeutic choices for patients and their treaters,” says AnnA Van Acker, President, Merck Canada. “BRENZYS® adds to Merck’s portfolio of treatments for dermatological and inflammatory immune diseases and can help improve quality of life for patients living with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, as well as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.”

About BRENZYS®

BRENZYS® is a biosimilar biologic drug (biosimilar)15 and authorized based on its similarity to ENBREL®, which is already approved for use for PsO, PsA and JIA in Canada.16 A biosimilar is a biologic drug that is highly similar to a biologic drug already authorized for sale.17 Biosimilars are assessed and approved by Health Canada against the same meticulous standards used to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of all other biologic drugs.18 Biosimilars provide patients more treatment options to help manage their disease and symptoms.

In addition to its use for the treatment of JIA, PsO and PsA, BRENZYS® was first approved by Health Canada in 2016 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).19 It is administered by an injection under the skin and should be used under the guidance and supervision of a physician.20

Clinical efficacy and safety studies have been conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to demonstrate clinical comparability between BRENZYS® and ENBREL®. The extrapolation of these data to support uses of BRENZYS® in ankylosing spondylitis is based on the demonstrated comparability, in terms of product quality, non-clinical, human pharmacokinetic and clinical characteristics. Randomized clinical trials have not been conducted to compare BRENZYS® to Enbrel® in patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and pediatric psoriasis.21

The most common expected adverse reactions with BRENZYS® are infections, injection site reactions and headaches. It should not be administered to patients with or at risk of sepsis. BRENZYS® contains a Boxed Warning to alert health care professionals and patients about an increased risk of serious infections including tuberculosis and infections caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi that have spread throughout their body. The Boxed Warning also notes that malignancies, sometimes fatal, have been reported in children and teenage patients who started using TNF-blocking agents, including etanercept, at less than 18 years of age.22

— Additional Studies Are Evaluating Magrolimab in Both Hematologic and Solid Tumors —

FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for magrolimab, a first-in-class, investigational anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

MDS is a type of cancer caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells in the bone marrow. Approximately 15,000 people are diagnosed with MDS in the U.S. each year, and no new treatments have been approved in 14 years. The average survival rate for those with lower-risk MDS is six years and approximately 18 months for those with higher-risk MDS.

Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of investigational treatments for serious or life-threatening conditions that, based on preliminary clinical evidence, have the potential to substantially improve clinical outcomes compared with available therapy.

The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for magrolimab based on positive results of an ongoing Phase 1b study, which evaluated magrolimab in combination with azacitidine in previously untreated intermediate, high and very high-risk MDS. In data presented at the 2020 European Hematology Society Congress, 91 percent of evaluable patients (n=33) treated with magrolimab plus azacitidine achieved an objective response, with 42 percent achieving a complete remission (CR). The combination of magrolimab plus azacitidine was generally well-tolerated. No maximum tolerated dose was reached and no MDS patients discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related adverse event.

“The Breakthrough Therapy designation recognizes the potential for magrolimab to help address a significant unmet medical need for people with MDS and underscores the transformative potential of Gilead’s immuno-oncology therapies in development,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences.

Magrolimab is currently being studied in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 3 ENHANCE trial in previously untreated higher risk MDS. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of magrolimab, in combination with azacitidine, as measured by CR and duration of CR.

Magrolimab is an investigational agent and has not been approved anywhere globally. Its safety and efficacy have not been established.

About Magrolimab

Magrolimab is a first-in-class investigational monoclonal antibody against CD47 and macrophage checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to interfere with recognition of CD47 by the SIRPα receptor on macrophages, thus blocking the “don’t eat me” signal used by cancer cells to avoid being ingested by macrophages. Magrolimab is being developed in several hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including MDS. Magrolimab has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma. Magrolimab has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for MDS and AML and by the European Medicines Agency for AML.

Additional information on magrolimab clinical trials is available on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

48584,Roche's CINtec PLUS Cytology Test Receives the US FDA's Approval to Aid Clinicians in Preventing Cervical Cancer,Roche receives FDA approval for expanded use of the CINtec PLUS Cytology test to aid clinicians in preventing cervical cancer,"The approval is based on IMPACT trial, which enrolled ~ 35,000 women to clinically validate CINtec PLUS Cytology as a triage test in various screening scenarios. Publication of the full study findings is pending
 The approval gives laboratories access to the complete Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio in the US, including the cobas HPV Test, CINtec PLUS Cytology, and CINtec Histology. The approval allows the test to be set as triage for positive cobas HPV tests run on cobas 6800/8800 Systems in primary screening or co-testing programs
 The CINtec PLUS Cytology test runs on the BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH system and is performed using the same sample that is used for HPV or liquid-based Pap cytology tests. The assay detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers (p16 and Ki-67) and a positive result signals that a woman is at risk for disease","Next-generation biomarker cytology test supports World Health Organization’s goal to eliminate cervical cancer, which is nearly 100 percent preventable with proper screening, vaccination and treatment
New indication allows this first FDA-approved biomarker-based test to be used as triage for positive cobas HPV tests run on cobas 6800/8800 Systems in primary screening or co-testing programs
More sensitive than traditional Pap cytology, this test allows clinicians to determine which HPV-positive women require further diagnostic procedures to prevent disease progression 
Basel, 16 September 2020 — Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the expanded use of CINtec® PLUS Cytology, the first triage test based on biomarker technology for women whose cervical cancer screening results are positive for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Additional information from this test supports clinical decisions about which women will benefit most from immediate follow-up. Laboratories can now use CINtec PLUS Cytology to triage positive results from the cobas® HPV Test run on the fully integrated, automated and high-throughput cobas® 6800/8800 Systems.

High-risk HPV is the principal cause of cervical cancer, which is one of the most common cancers in women globally. The World Health Organization has set goals for countries to take action to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030.

“With our portfolio of cervical cancer tests and automated testing platforms, we are committed to providing clinicians and laboratories with the best tools possible to protect women’s health,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This expanded indication for CINtec PLUS Cytology gives laboratories the flexibility to triage cobas HPV test results on their choice of cobas® Systems and deliver accuracy needed to reliably detect HPV infections that are starting to cause cellular changes that could lead to cancer. The biomarker information helps to clarify a woman’s risk of disease, reduce the potential for over- or under-treatment, and is a major step forward in individualising a woman’s care.”

HPV DNA screening identifies women at risk for cervical cancer by detecting the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in cervical samples. While most HPV infections resolve on their own, some women who test positive for the virus, or whose co-testing results are discrepant (HPV positive/Pap cytology negative), may have or may develop pre-cancerous cervical lesions. These lesions could progress to cervical cancer if left untreated.

About human papillomavirus and cervical cancer
Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the principal cause of cervical cancer in women, with HPV implicated in greater than 99 percent of cervical cancers worldwide.1 Cervical cancer is nearly 100 percent preventable with proper HPV vaccination, screening and treatment; expanding access helps reach more women in underserved communities where the disease burden is highest.2,3 It can take 10 to 15 years or longer for cervical cancer to develop, so knowing a woman’s individual risk and finding disease early, before cancer develops, is an important prevention strategy.

About 13,800 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 4,290 women will die from the disease this year. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are more than 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer annually, and 311,000 deaths.4 Learn more about the Roche Cervical Cancer Global Access Program.

About CINtec PLUS Cytology
The CINtec PLUS Cytology test detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers — p16 and Ki-67. This abnormality is associated with HPV infections that are transforming and can, if left untreated, progress to pre-cancer or cancer. A positive result of these two biomarkers in a single cell signals that a woman is more significantly at risk for disease. The ability of CINtec PLUS Cytology to distinguish those women who are at higher risk for cervical disease provides labs, physicians and women, in conjunction with the clinician’s assessment of patient screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines information, to guide patient management. Women with negative dual stain results are at significantly lower risk for cervical disease and their bodies can be given more time to clear HPV infection on their own. This could reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits, saving some patients worry and time.

The CINtec PLUS Cytology test, which runs on the BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH system, is performed using the same sample that is used for HPV or liquid-based Pap cytology tests. This eliminates the need for additional or repeat sample collection or time spent waiting to find out if an infection is clearing.

For U.S. approval, the FDA considered data from the Roche-sponsored registrational IMPACT (IMproving Primary screening And Colposcopy Triage) trial, which enrolled approximately 35,000 women in the U.S. to clinically validate CINtec PLUS Cytology as a triage test in various screening scenarios. This latest expanded use approval gives laboratories access to the complete Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio offering in the U.S., which includes the cobas HPV Test, CINtec PLUS Cytology and CINtec Histology. Depending on their workflow needs, labs now have the choice to fully automate their highest volume assays and utilise biomarker technology to offer more advanced, next-generation cytology solutions. Publication of the full IMPACT study findings is pending.

Prior to FDA approvals for its use for the triage of women who are HPV positive using the cobas HPV Test on the cobas® 4800 or cobas 6800/8800 Systems, the CINtec PLUS Cytology CE-IVD test had been used as a triage test for HPV-positive results and mildly abnormal Pap cytology results in Europe, Asia, South America, Canada and Australia.

About the Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio
The Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio enables healthcare professionals to screen, triage and diagnose women, based on the confidence and clarity of results across a continuum of patient care. The unique combination of molecular, cellular cytology and tissue-based tests provides healthcare professionals powerful information to make patient care decisions and minimise unnecessary treatment. Along with cobas HPV for screening, and CINtec PLUS Cytology, CINtec Histology is used as an aid to confirm the presence of cervical disease in women who have had a tissue biopsy. CINtec Histology is the only FDA-cleared test that uses the p16 biomarker for a more conclusive diagnosis to provide distinctive visual confirmation of precancerous cervical lesions that may be missed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) interpretation alone. Like CINtec PLUS Cytology, CINtec Histology is also fully automated on the BenchMark IHC/ISH instruments.

About the BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH system
The BenchMark ULTRA system is a fully automated immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization slide staining system, offering multiple features designed to provide diagnostic confidence to histopathology laboratories worldwide. With 30 independent slide drawers, the system gives histotechnologists continuous random access and supports single-piece workflow, which numerous studies have shown improves laboratory operational efficiency.

 LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 mAb targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is well tolerated with no AEs. The BLAZE-1 study is ongoing with additional treatment arms","– Primary endpoint of viral load change from baseline at day 11 was met for one of three doses; consistent effects of viral reduction seen at earlier time points

– Rate of hospitalizations and ER visits was 1.7 percent (5/302) for LY-CoV555 versus 6 percent (9/150) for placebo–a 72 percent risk reduction in this limited population

– LY-CoV555 was well-tolerated across all doses with no drug-related serious adverse events reported

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced proof of concept data from an interim analysis of the BLAZE-1 clinical trial, showing a reduced rate of hospitalization for patients treated with LY-CoV555. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluated LY-CoV555, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. The trial enrolled mild-to-moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients across four groups (placebo, 700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg).

The prespecified primary endpoint, change from baseline in viral load at day 11, was met at the 2800 mg dose level, but not the others. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, demonstrated near complete viral clearance by day 11. Additional analyses of viral data demonstrated that LY-CoV555 improved viral clearance at an earlier time point (day 3) and reduced the proportion of patients with persistently high viral load at later time points.

These biomarker data correlated with LY-CoV555’s positive impact on the prespecified endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalization or ER visit. This endpoint occurred in 1.7 percent (5/302) of LY-CoV555 patients, pooled across dose groups, as compared to 6 percent (9/150) of placebo patients, which corresponds to a 72 percent risk reduction in this limited population. Most study hospitalizations occurred in patients with underlying risk factors (age or BMI), suggesting a more pronounced treatment effect for patients in these higher-risk groups. Ongoing studies will seek to confirm this finding. Across all treatment groups (including placebo), no patients progressed to mechanical ventilation or died. Exploratory analyses indicated a more rapid improvement in symptoms for patients treated with LY-CoV555 versus placebo, supporting the hospitalization effect.

LY-CoV555 was well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. Treatment emergent adverse events were similar across all dose groups and comparable to placebo. Viral RNA sequencing revealed putative LY-CoV555-resistance variants in placebo and all treatment arms. The rate of resistance variants was numerically higher in treated patients (8 percent) versus placebo (6 percent).

“These interim data from the BLAZE-1 trial suggest that LY-CoV555, an antibody specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2, has a direct antiviral effect and may reduce COVID-related hospitalizations,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “The results reinforce our conviction that neutralizing antibodies can help in the fight against COVID-19.”

Lilly intends to quickly publish the results of this interim analysis in a peer-reviewed journal and discuss appropriate next steps with global regulators. The BLAZE-1 clinical trial remains ongoing, testing LY-CoV555 in combination with a second Lilly antibody, LY-CoV016, which binds a different epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The trial is currently enrolling a larger, confirmatory cohort of higher risk patients, testing the ability of the antibody combination to reduce the number of patients with persistently high viral load and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations.

“We are grateful to the patients, physicians, and staff that have participated in this trial,” Skovronsky continued. “We look forward to continued data generation as this trial proceeds.”

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 800 participants.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild-to-moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients across four groups (placebo, LY-CoV555 700 mg, LY-CoV555 2800 mg, and LY-CoV555 7000 mg). To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than 3 days prior to drug infusion.

The primary outcome measure for the BLAZE-1 monotherapy arms was change from baseline to Day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through Day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms.

About LY-CoV555 
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and tested by the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed enrollment and primary safety assessments of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501) is ongoing. Lilly recently initiated a Phase 3 study for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

 The company highlights the role CCL14 biomarkers in predicting persistent AKI in the RUBY study demonstrating that 33% met the criteria for persistent stage 3 AKI. The NEPHROCLEAR CCL14 test is not currently approved for use in the US & EU","Reinforces Baxter’s commitment to purposeful innovation that supports broader acute kidney injury (AKI) management to improve patient outcomes
Combines Baxter’s global leadership in blood purification and focus on advancing patient-centered care with bioMérieux’s global leadership in diagnostics
Recent study highlights role of biomarker in predicting persistent severe AKI
DEERFIELD, Ill.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global leader in acute care, today announced a distribution agreement with bioMérieux (EPA:BIM), a global leader in in vitro diagnostics, for the NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 diagnostic test. The NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 test is currently in development for use in assessing the risk of developing persistent severe acute kidney injury (AKI). The agreement is part of a previously announced collaboration between Baxter and bioMérieux to improve identification and treatment of AKI. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

As part of the agreement, Baxter will be bioMérieux’s exclusive distributor of the NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 test in Europe and the U.S. following regulatory approval and launch in both markets. Baxter and bioMérieux will share in-country commercialization, while bioMérieux will retain control over the regulatory approval process. Incorporating new diagnostic products into Baxter’s Acute Therapies portfolio advances the company’s efforts to support overall patient management by providing solutions that enable efficiencies in critical care.

“Baxter’s agreement with bioMérieux will allow us to introduce a new diagnostic offering to our Acute Therapies portfolio and offer clinicians a meaningful tool as they manage the complexities of AKI in their patients,” said Reaz Rasul, general manager of Baxter’s Acute Therapies business.

AKI is a potentially life-threatening condition where the kidneys suddenly stop working, often as the result of illness, trauma or infection. The sudden loss of kidney function leads to the accumulation of toxins and fluid in the blood that, if left untreated, may lead to death. AKI is an increasingly common complication of acute illnesses in intensive care units and hospitals.123 The ability to predict persistent severe AKI could help physicians determine which patients are likely to recover on their own and which patients may require more intensive management, including evaluation of renal replacement therapy (“dialysis”) to replace the function of the kidneys.4 Currently, physicians are evaluating the likelihood of renal recovery and making decisions on when to initiate renal replacement therapy with conventional markers such as creatinine and urine output, which have well-known limitations.

“bioMérieux continues to focus on high-medical-value diagnostics which directly benefit patients and improve their healthcare. The development of the NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 test is consistent with our mission to aid in the care of individuals with acute medical and critical conditions like AKI and complements our existing pioneering assays for these types of patients such as procalcitonin (PCT) and NEPHROCHECK®,” said Mark Miller, executive vice president and chief medical officer at bioMérieux.

Role of CCL14 Biomarker in Predicting Persistent AKI

A recent study published in Intensive Care Medicinefound that urinary CCL14 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 14), the novel biomarker measured by the NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 test, is the most predictive of persistent stage 3 AKI, the most severe form of AKI,5 when compared with other AKI biomarkers (NGAL, CHI3L1, L-FABP, Cystatin C, Proenkephalin, KIM-1 and IL-18).6 The multi-center international prospective observational study, titled “Identification and validation of biomarkers of persistent acute kidney injury: the RUBY study,” enrolled 364 patients in the intensive care unit with moderate or severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3), of whom 331 were available for the primary analysis. In the analysis cohort, 110 patients (33%) met the criteria for persistent stage 3 AKI.

The study considered a broad set of potential biomarkers that were measured in urine and/or plasma by technicians blinded to clinical data. The study authors used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which summarizes the overall accuracy of a diagnostic test, to assess the predictive ability of the biomarkers. They found that the CCL14 biomarker had an AUC (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.78–0.87),6 which can be considered excellent7 and was significantly (p<0.05) greater than values for the other biomarkers tested.6

The NEPHROCLEARTM CCL14 test is not currently approved for use in Europe or the United States.

COMBI-AD is first trial to demonstrate 5-year relapse-free survival with targeted therapy as adjuvant treatment in high-risk patients with stage III BRAF-mutated melanoma1
Adjuvant treatment with standard-of-care targeted therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist reduced the risk of relapse or death by 49% compared to placebo1
Updated data show Tafinlar + Mekinist improved distant metastasis-free survival, a secondary endpoint1
 
Basel, September 16, 2020 — Novartis announced previously reported data from the Phase III COMBI-AD study were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study shows more than half of high-risk patients with resected, stage III BRAF V600-mutated melanoma treated with Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) + Mekinist® (trametinib) were alive and relapse-free at 5 years1. Research suggests the majority of relapses in high-risk stage III melanoma generally occur within 5 years1,2.

“Findings published today offer confidence that treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib following surgery provides a durable, long-term relapse-free survival benefit for those at high risk of cancer recurrence,” said Prof. Reinhard Dummer, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Zurich. “These findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the clinical value of dabrafenib and trametinib in the adjuvant setting.”

Results showed 52% of patients (95% CI, 48-58%) treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist were alive and relapse-free at 5 years compared to 36% of patients (95% CI, 32-41%) who received placebo. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was not reached in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm (95% CI, 47.9 months-NR) compared to 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.7-22.1 months) in the placebo arm. Treatment with Tafinlar + Mekinist reduced the risk of relapse or death by 49% compared to placebo (hazard ratio, HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42-0.61])1. These findings were presented at the 2020 ASCO Virtual Scientific Program.

A subgroup analysis showed a generally similar RFS benefit across all substages, as assessed by AJCC-7 criteria. The five-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rate, a secondary endpoint, was 65% (95% CI, 61-71%) in patients treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist compared to 54% (95% CI, 49-60%) in patients who received placebo. COMBI-AD is ongoing to assess the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS); the OS analysis at the first interim analysis showed a 3-year OS rate of 86% in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm compared to 77% in the placebo arm. Overall survival results favored the combination therapy with Tafinlar + Mekinist over placebo, but the prespecified interim significance threshold of P = 0.000019 was not met.

“Reaching the five year mark without relapse is a profound moment for a patient living with high-risk, stage III melanoma,” said Jeff Legos, Ph.D., MBA, Senior Vice President, Head of Oncology Drug Development, Novartis Oncology. “Tafinlar + Mekinist has helped patients and clinicians reimagine what is possible for patients living with advanced melanoma. We are proud of the deep and durable benefit demonstrated in COMBI-AD and remain grateful to the patients, investigators and their families who participated in this clinical trial.”

During the extended follow-up, all patients had completed therapy. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the Tafinlar + Mekinist and placebo arms in the rate or severity of serious adverse events reported during the follow-up period.

More than 285,000 cases of melanoma are diagnosed every year globally and about half of these have a BRAF mutation3,4. Patients who receive surgical treatment for stage III melanoma may have a risk of recurrence because melanoma cells may remain in the body after surgery5.

About the COMBI-AD Study
COMBI-AD is a pivotaI Phase III study evaluating Tafinlar (dabrafenib) + Mekinist (trametinib) in patients with stage III, BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma without prior anticancer therapy. It is the longest follow-up, at 60 months, and largest dataset to date of patients with stage III melanoma receiving targeted therapy for adjuvant treatment1,6.

It is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind Phase III study of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma after surgical resection. Patients with completely resected, histologically confirmed, BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive, high-risk [stage IIIa (lymph node metastasis >1 mm), IIIb or IIIc as per AJCC 7th edition] cutaneous melanoma were screened for eligibility. Subjects were randomized to receive either dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) combination therapy or two placebos for up to one year. The primary end point is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, freedom from relapse analysis and safety1,7.

About Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination
Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:

That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and
That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) gene
Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF V600E” gene.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):

That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and
That has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type BRAF melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a BRAF inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.

Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist , in combination, are right for you.

It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.

Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for any skin changes, including a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.

When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.

Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause blood clots in the arms or legs, which can travel to the lungs and can lead to death. Patients should be advised to get medical help right away if they have the following symptoms: chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or trouble breathing, pain in their legs with or without swelling, swelling in their arms or legs, or a cool or pale arm or leg.

The combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist can cause heart problems, including heart failure. A patient’s heart function should be checked before and during treatment. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they have any of the following signs and symptoms of a heart problem: feeling like their heart is pounding or racing, shortness of breath, swelling of their ankles and feet, or feeling lightheaded.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause severe eye problems that can lead to blindness. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get: blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes, seeing color dots, halo (seeing blurred outline around objects), eye pain, swelling, or redness.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause lung or breathing problems. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have new or worsening symptoms of lung or breathing problems, including shortness of breath or cough.

Fever is common during treatment with Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist, but may also be serious. In some cases, chills or shaking chills, too much fluid loss (dehydration), low blood pressure, dizziness, or kidney problems may happen with the fever. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get a fever.

Rash and other skin reactions are common side effects of Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist. In some cases, these rashes and other skin reactions can be severe or serious, may need to be treated in a hospital, or lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider if they get any of the following symptoms: blisters or peeling of skin, mouth sores, blisters on the lips or around the mouth or eyes, high fever or flu-like symptoms, and/or enlarged lymph nodes.

Some people may develop high blood sugar or worsening diabetes during treatment with Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist. For patients who are diabetic, their health care provider should check their blood sugar levels closely during treatment. Their diabetes medicine may need to be changed. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have increased thirst, urinate more often than normal, or produce an increased amount of urine.

Tafinlar may cause healthy red blood cells to break down too early in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This may lead to a type of anemia called hemolytic anemia, where the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have yellow skin (jaundice), weakness or dizziness, or shortness of breath.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause new or worsening high blood pressure (hypertension). A patient’s blood pressure should be checked during treatment. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they develop high blood pressure, their blood pressure worsens, or if they have severe headache, lightheadedness, blurry vision, or dizziness.

Men (including those who have had a vasectomy) should use condoms during sexual intercourse during treatment with Tafinlar and Mekinist and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Tafinlar and Mekinist. For women of reproductive potential, Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may harm your unborn baby. Use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Tafinlar and Mekinist in combination, and for 4 months after stopping treatment with Tafinlar and Mekinist. The most common side effects for patients with metastatic melanoma are: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, hypertension, arthralgia, peripheral edema, and cough. The most common side effects for patients with stage III melanoma receiving the combination as adjuvant therapy are: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, headache, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. The most common side effects for patients with NSCLC: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, rash, chills, hemorrhage, cough, and dyspnea.

Phase 1 clinical trial for STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD™) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients has received FDA notice that it may proceed with patient enrollment.
The initial trial is expected to enroll rapidly and is expected to be followed by large trials targeting a potential Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission as early as before the end of this year.
Sorrento has initiated cGMP manufacturing to produce 50,000 doses in anticipation of a potential EUA.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) announced today that it received a study may proceed letter from the FDA for its phase 1 clinical trial for COVI-GUARD (STI-1499) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

As Sorrento previously announced, in preclinical studies, STI-1499 demonstrated 100% in vitro neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2, preventing infection of healthy cells in such preclinical in vitro studies.

STI-1499 was further evaluated in preclinical studies using multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the highly contagious D614G variant. In these preclinical studies, the antibody has been 100% effective against the highly contagious D614G variant strain at similar doses to those observed in experiments with the USA-WA1/2020 strain.

Animal data generated in Syrian Golden hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 was presented to the FDA in support of a post-exposure human treatment dose for the IND. The effective dose in the hamster model translates to a projected total dose of approximately 160mg for a human patient.

The highest proposed dose (200 mg per patient) in the phase 1 trial is a lower dose than currently being tested for other known SARS-CoV-2 targeted antibodies or antibody cocktails in active clinical studies. The potentially high potency of STI-1499 antibody may allow for rapid scaling up of manufacturing operations.

The STI-1499 clinical program is being designed for rapid adaptive expansion, including international sites in Brazil to supplement the US program.

More information about the phase 1 clinical trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT# 04454398).

Impact of COVID-19 on cancer care: Roche live virtual panel discussions and Q&As featuring world leading healthcare experts

Basel, 17 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that results from a number of studies across its broad oncology portfolio will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020, which will be held 19-21 September, 2020. Results include data from three phase III studies across the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) programme. Central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from integrated analyses of the pivotal phase II Rozlytrek® STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1, and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials will be presented in addition to results from the registrational phase I/II ARROW trial, investigating GavretoTM for the treatment of people with advanced, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Data from the phase III IPATential150 study in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and whose tumours had PTEN loss will also be shared.

Roche will also be hosting a live roundtable discussion that will focus on COVID-19 and the impact it may have on the outcomes for cancer patients. The discussion will focus on potential solutions and what lessons have been learned from the pandemic so far. Two additional sessions will look into pandemic-related lessons learned with regards to the integration of technology into patient management and the impact of digital tumour board solutions on multidisciplinary meetings.

“Our commitment to transforming the outcomes of people living with cancer remains steadfast, so we are proud to be presenting data at this year’s congress that advances the scientific understanding of multiple complex diseases,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D. Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “As a direct result of the pandemic, many countries are reporting a disruption to cancer care which could potentially result in the premature deaths of tens of thousands of cancer patients. Therefore, we must work together to ensure that we do not swap one health crisis for another: cancer patients simply cannot afford to wait.”

The pandemic has accelerated the need for collaboration among all stakeholders involved in cancer care to address key gaps and challenges that require urgent action by governments and policy makers. To discuss these issues and call for a course correction for all cancer care services, a live virtual panel discussion and Q&A featuring leading experts from medical societies, academia and the patient group community, will take place on Tuesday 22 September 2020, 15:00 CEST. Join this event on Roche’s LinkedIn page here. Two additional sessions will look into related topics in the context of treatment decision making. In the first session, insights will be shared by Italian experts on how the pandemic has affected cancer care and how digital solutions helped them to continue shared decision making remotely. Sign up here for the session on Saturday, 19 September, 16:00-16:30 CEST. The second talk illustrates challenges faced by multidisciplinary teams when convening tumour boards and their real-world experience with a digital tumour board solution in the pandemic. Sign up here for the session on Saturday, 19 September, 16:30-17:00 CEST.

Roche highlights featured at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020

Breast cancer portfolio
At ESMO, results from recent studies across the Tecentriq TNBC programme (both early and metastatic TNBC) will be presented, including final OS analysis from the phase III IMpassion130 study (Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel [Abraxane® [paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)] in mTNBC)], results from the IMpassion031 study (Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel [Abraxane, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide] in the early TNBC setting), and results from the phase III IMpassion131 study (Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel in mTNBC).

In HER2-positive breast cancer, results will highlight our focus on improving patients’ experience of cancer treatment, looking beyond efficacy outcomes and focusing on more flexible treatment solutions. Data from the phase II PHranceSCa study show the majority of patients prefer treatment with Phesgo™, a subcutaneous (SC) fixed-dose combination of Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab), compared to standard intravenous formulations. Phesgo was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, about four months earlier than anticipated, for the treatment of early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Based on the decision of the treating physician and the preference of the patient, it can be administered by a healthcare professional in a treatment centre or in a patient’s home.

Data will also be presented for two of our investigational hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer treatments, both of which target the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, a key driver of cancer cell growth and proliferation. GDC-0077 is our next generation investigational PI3Kα-selective inhibitor and mutant PI3Kα degrader designed to inhibit the growth of tumour cells that have mutations in the PIK3CA gene. We will present PI3K pathway biomarker and clinical response data from a phase I/Ib study of GDC-0077 and announce the design of an ongoing phase III study evaluating GDC-0077 in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. In addition, results will be shared from phase III IPATunity130 cohort B assessing ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered HR-positive advanced breast cancer.

Tecentriq in lung cancer
Results from an exploratory analysis of characterisation of long-term survivors (LTS), defined in the study as people who survived for longer than 18 months following randomisation, in the IMpower133 trial will be presented in a mini-oral session. The study previously showed that Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) live significantly longer compared with chemotherapy alone. SCLC is distinguished from other lung cancer subtypes due to its aggressive nature, rapid growth and early development of metastatic disease.

In addition, four-year survival data from the phase II POPLAR and phase III OAK studies, investigating Tecentriq vs docetaxel (chemotherapy) in patients with advanced pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be presented.

Tumour-agnostic data
Two sets of CNS efficacy data from integrated analyses of the pivotal phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1, and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials will be presented, including a poster presentation evaluating the efficacy of Rozlytrek in patients with NTRK or ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC, who have CNS metastases at baseline; and an oral presentation evaluating the intracranial efficacy of Rozlytrek in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours with baseline CNS metastasis. In addition, an updated integrated analysis of the phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1, and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, investigating the efficacy and safety of Rozlytrek in locally advanced/metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC, which evaluated a larger dataset with longer follow-up (15.8 months) will be presented.

Gavreto in RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer
At ESMO, Blueprint Medicines will present results from the registrational phase I/II ARROW trial, investigating Gavreto for the treatment of people with advanced, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer. Gavreto is being jointly commercialised by Genentech, a wholly owned member of the Roche Group, and Blueprint Medicines in the U.S. and will be commercialised by Roche outside of the U.S., excluding Greater China (encompasses Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). Blueprint Medicines and Gavreto are trademarks of Blueprint Medicines Corporation.

Subcutaneous formulation of atezolizumab (Tecentriq)
First data from the phase Ib dose-finding study (Part 1 of IMscin001) of subcutaneous atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will also be presented. The subcutaneous formulation of atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is being developed to potentially allow faster administration via an injection under the skin, compared to the original intravenous (IV) formulation, thereby significantly reducing a patient’s time spent receiving treatment. Based on previous studies of other monoclonal antibodies, subcutaneous is generally a preferred route of administration by patients, physicians, healthcare providers and can be associated with hospital time- and cost-savings.

PHC symposium
In light of ESMO’s 2020 motto, “bringing innovation to cancer patients”, Roche is hosting a symposium that explores what it takes to put personalised healthcare at the heart of clinical practice. Leading experts will discuss recent innovations in the field of personalised healthcare within oncology like the use of blood based molecular testing. Furthermore, the panelists will also discuss how to accelerate the adoption personalised oncology in healthcare systems. The symposium is tailored for healthcare professionals and includes a virtual live Q&A with the faculty on Friday, 18 September, 17:00-17:30 CEST.

48664,NS Phrama's Viltepso (viltolarsen) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Amenable to Exon 53 Skipping Therapy,NS Pharma’s VILTEPSO™ (viltolarsen) injection Now FDA-Approved in the U.S. for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in Patients Amenable to Exon 53 Skipping Therapy,"The approval is based on P-II two period study; Study 1 includes patients aged 4-10yrs. conducted in North America and Study 2 includes boys aged 5-18yrs. conducted in Japan. The continued approval of VILTEPSO may contingent on confirmation of clinical benefit in P-III confirmatory trial
 Results: patients receiving the dose of (80 mg/kg/wk), 100% patients showed increase in dystrophin levels; 88% patients showed dystrophin levels of 3% or greater than normal; after 20-24wks. of treatment, increment in dystrophin expression (6% vs 0.6%)
 Viltepso has received PR designation, RPD, FT & ODD, prior to its FDA’s approval. In Mar’2020, it has received MHLW’s approval, prior to which it received SAKIGAKE, ODD and designation of conditional early approval system","PARAMUS, N.J., Aug. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — NS Pharma, Inc. (NS Pharma; President, Tsugio Tanaka), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. (Nippon Shinyaku; President Shigenobu Maekawa), announced today that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved VILTEPSO™ (viltolarsen) injection for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. VILTEPSO received an Accelerated Approval by the FDA based on an increase in dystrophin, a key protein for supporting muscle health. Since a lack of dystrophin is the underlying cause of DMD, increasing dystrophin as much and as early as possible is a key goal in the treatment of DMD. VILTEPSO is the first and only exon 53 skipping therapy to demonstrate an increase in dystrophin in children as young as four years old. The continued approval of VILTEPSO may be contingent on confirmation of a clinical benefit in a Phase 3 confirmatory trial.

DMD is caused by genetic mutations that prevent dystrophin production. Patients with DMD experience progressive and irreversible muscle loss with symptoms appearing as early as two years of age. Cardiac and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teenage years and lead to serious, life-threatening complications.

The VILTEPSO New Drug Application (NDA) submission included results from a Phase 2, two-period study in patients aged four to less than 10 years of age conducted in North America (Study 1, N=16) and a multicenter, open-label study in boys five to less than 18 years of age conducted in Japan (Study 2, N=16).

In Study 1, of those patients who received the recommended dose of 80 mg/kg/wk (N=8), 100% of patients (8/8) showed an increase in dystrophin levels after treatment with VILTEPSO and 88% of patients (7/8) showed dystrophin levels of 3% or greater than normal. Overall, after 20-24 weeks of treatment a mean increase in dystrophin expression to nearly 6% of normal was observed with VILTEPSO (80 mg/kg/wk) versus 0.6% at baseline.

The most common side effects of VILTEPSO included upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, cough and fever.

“For decades, neurologists who treat DMD have hoped for the discovery of therapies capable of significantly improving dystrophin production, and the magnitude of dystrophin increases observed with VILTEPSO are impressive,” said study investigator Vamshi Rao, MD, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “The approval of VILTEPSO is an exciting development for DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy and may rapidly become a foundational treatment for these patients.”

Patients receiving treatment with VILTEPSO have the option and flexibility to receive infusions at their home or at a hospital or treatment center. VILTEPSO is administered by a trained healthcare professional as an 80 mg per kg of body weight 60-minute weekly intravenous infusion.

NS Pharma will provide families, physicians and healthcare professionals dedicated and individualized resources every step of the way through the NS Support program. NS Pharma will be hosting a series of webinars on the comprehensive care coordination available through NS Support. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter for information and registration for upcoming webinars.

“On behalf of NS Pharma and Nippon Shinyaku, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to the families and physicians who participated in our clinical trials and made today’s approval possible,” said Tsugio Tanaka, President, NS Pharma, Inc. “We are proud to now offer an important new treatment option to help address the significant unmet needs caused by this devastating disease.”

NS Pharma continues to study the safety and efficacy of VILTEPSO in the confirmatory Phase 3 RACER53 trial. This study was initiated in October 2019 and is currently enrolling. The purpose of this Phase 3 trial is to confirm the clinical findings that were submitted under the Accelerated Approval pathway.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)
DMD is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss of skeletal, cardiac, and pulmonary muscles. Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand or walk. There is a progressive loss of mobility, and by adolescence, patients with DMD may require the use of a wheelchair. Cardiac and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teenage years and lead to serious, life-threatening complications.

August 07, 2020 09:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WHIPPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bayer announced today that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lampit® (nifurtimox) for use in pediatric patients (from birth to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 2.5 kg) for the treatment of Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi).1 Lampit, an antiprotozoal medication will be available in a new, dividable tablet that can be split on the scored lines by hand.1-3 According to prescribing instructions, the tablet is specially formulated to disperse in water, which can aid in the dosing and administration to pediatric patients who may have difficulty swallowing whole or half tablets.1-3

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the number of treated patients who became immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody negative or who showed an at least 20% decrease in optical density on two different IgG antibody tests against antigens of T. cruzi. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

Chagas is an infectious tropical disease that affects an estimated 300,000 people in the U.S.4 The disease is endemic throughout much of Latin America, though it is a growing health concern in the U.S.5,6 Approval of a treatment for pediatric patients is an important milestone.

“Chagas disease can strike at any age, and early detection and treatment are important. This is especially relevant for children,” said Aleksandra Vlajnic, MD, senior vice president and head of Medical Affairs for the Americas at Bayer. “The importance of treating children is a major reason behind Bayer’s collaboration with health authorities to enhance access to Lampit as a means to provide treatment for Chagas disease.”

The FDA approval is based on results from the Chagas disease in children treated with nifurtimox study, the first part of the largest Phase III program ever conducted in pediatric patients for the treatment of Chagas disease.

“In the study, Lampit showed good antiprotozoal activity in patients from 0 to 17 years old,” said Jaime Altcheh, MD, head of the Department of Parasitology and Chagas disease at the Ricardo Gutierrez Children’s Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and coordinating investigator of the Phase III trial.

The Phase III Lampit study was the first part of a prospective, randomized (to dosing regimen), double-blind evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nifurtimox in 330 children with Chagas disease.1 The study was conducted at 25 investigational sites in Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia between 2016 and 2018.7 In the study, 330 pediatric patients with serologic evidence of T. cruzi infection (without Chagas disease-related cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to receive either a 60-day (n=219) or a 30-day (n=111) Lampit treatment regimen, and were followed up for one year after end of treatment.1 The results showed superiority in favor of the nifurtimox 60-day arm compared to the nifurtimox 30-day arm (not an approved dosing regimen). For additional clinical trial information, go to clinicaltrials.gov NCT02625974 and see full prescribing information.1,7

The study will continue with a second part (Lampit SECURE) to follow patients for an additional three years to confirm efficacy and safety.

Now that Lampit is approved for pediatric use in the U.S., Bayer is working to ensure access to the drug for all patients through retail channels. Commercially insured patients may qualify for a $0 co-pay to help with their out-of-pocket costs. For uninsured patients who cannot afford Lampit, the Bayer U.S. Patient Assistance Foundation, a charitable organization, will help eligible patients obtain the prescription medication at no cost. Restrictions apply. See Program Details for full information. Lampit is not approved in the U.S. for use in adults 18 years of age or older.

About Chagas Disease

Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and is primarily transmitted to humans via the feces of infected triatomines, insects that are also known as “kissing bugs” where the disease is present. Chagas disease can also be transmitted by infected organ transplantation, infected blood transfusion, during pregnancy or birth from an infected mother to her child, and less frequently through ingestion of contaminated food.4-6,8-10

Although the disease can be curable when detected and treated soon after the infection, untreated individuals become carriers and move to the chronic phase of the disease. Approximately 30% of these people may experience life-threatening cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications.11

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 6 to 7 million people around the world are infected with Chagas disease.12,13 The majority of infected individuals are in Latin America, where Chagas remains one of the region’s biggest public health problems, causing incapacity in infected individuals and more than 10,000 deaths per year.14 Today, less than 1% of people infected with Chagas disease worldwide are treated due to low disease awareness and limited access to treatment.13

Bayer’s Historical Commitment to Chagas Disease Patients

After discovering nifurtimox at its laboratories in Wuppertal, Germany, Bayer first introduced nifurtimox as Lampit in Argentina in the 1970s, and shortly afterwards made the medication available in other Latin American countries. Nifurtimox is on the list of WHO’s Lists of Essential Medicines, a list of safe and effective medicines needed for priority conditions in a health system.15 In 2002, the WHO entered into an agreement with Bayer by which the company would provide the medication as a donation, as well as financial resources for logistics and distribution, disease education and training, and disease surveillance activities.16 Today, Lampit is one of only two drugs available in the world to treat Chagas disease.17,18

Lampit is currently registered in several Latin American countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) for the treatment of acute and chronic Chagas disease in adults and children. The company is working to improve access to Lampit by expanding the number of countries with registrations for the product.

Indication

Lampit® (nifurtimox) is an antiprotozoal medication indicated for use in pediatric patients (from birth to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 2.5 kg) for the treatment of Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi).1 This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the number of treated patients who became immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody negative or who showed an at least 20% decrease in optical density on two different IgG antibody tests against antigens of T. cruzi. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).1

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Contraindications

LAMPIT tablets are contraindicated in:

Patients with known hypersensitivity to nifurtimox or any of the excipients in LAMPIT
Patients who consume alcohol during treatment
Warnings and Precautions

Potential for Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity

Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity of LAMPIT has been demonstrated in humans, in vitro in several bacterial species and mammalian cell systems, and in vivo in rodents.

A study evaluating the cytogenetic effect of nifurtimox in pediatric patients ranging from 7 months to 14 years of age with Chagas disease demonstrated a 13-fold increase in chromosomal aberrations.

Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity has been observed in mice and rats treated chronically with nitrofuran agents which are structurally similar to nifurtimox. Similar data have not been reported for LAMPIT. It is not known whether LAMPIT is associated with carcinogenicity in humans.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal studies, LAMPIT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, nifurtimox administered orally to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis was associated with reduced fetal body weights in rodents, and abortions, fetal death, and smaller litter sizes in rabbits at doses approximately equivalent to and 2-times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/kg/day. Fetal malformations were observed in pregnant rabbits administered nifurtimox doses less than the MRHD.

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with LAMPIT. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LAMPIT and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of LAMPIT.

Worsening of Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions

Patients with a history of brain injury, seizures, psychiatric disease, or serious behavioral alterations may experience worsening of their conditions when receiving LAMPIT. Administer LAMPIT under close medical supervision in these patients and in patients who develop neurological disturbances or psychiatric drug reactions.

Hypersensitivity

Cases of hypersensitivity have been reported in patients receiving therapy with nifurtimox. The hypersensitivity could be a reaction induced by nifurtimox or an immune response triggered by Chagas disease during treatment. Hypersensitivity reactions could be accompanied by hypotension, angioedema (including laryngeal or facial edema), dyspnea, pruritus, rash or other severe skin reactions. At the first sign of serious hypersensitivity, discontinue treatment with LAMPIT.

Decreased Appetite and Weight Loss

Decreased appetite and weight loss were reported in patients treated with LAMPIT in the clinical trials. During treatment with LAMPIT, patients can lose their appetite or experience nausea/vomiting which can result in weight loss. Check body weight every 14 days, as the dosage may have to be adjusted.

Porphyria

Treatment with nitrofuran derivatives, such as LAMPIT, may precipitate acute attacks of porphyria. Administer LAMPIT tablets under close medical supervision in patients with porphyria.

Adverse Reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥1%) in patients treated with nifurtimox were vomiting (14.6%); abdominal pain (13.2%); headache (12.8%); decreased appetite (10.5%); nausea (8.2%); pyrexia (7.3%); rash (5.5%), diarrhea (4.6%), weight decreased (2.7%); anemia (2.7%), dizziness (2.7%), eosinophilia (2.3%) and urticaria (2.3%).

48673,Trevena's Olinvyk (oliceridine) Receives the US FDA's Approval for the Treatment of Central Nervous System,Trevena Announces FDA Approval of OLINVYK™ (oliceridine) injection,"The approval is based on P-III development program assessing Olinvyk in <1,500 patients with moderate to severe acute pain. The loading dose for all Olinvyk treatment regimens (1.5 mg); demand dose (0.1,0.35,0.5mg); and supplemental dose (0.75 mg)
 Result: Olinvyk demonstrated rapid analgesic efficacy statistically significant vs. PBO. Patients using the Olinvyk (doses of 0.35 and 0.5 mg) had a statistically significantly greater SPID-48/24 than patients using PBO
 Olinvyk is a new chemical entity approved in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an IV opioid analgesic. Olinvyk’s product availability is expected in Q4’2020 after the issuing of controlled substance schedule by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)","CHESTERBROOK, Pa., Aug. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Trevena, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRVN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines for patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved OLINVYK in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. OLINVYK will be commercially available when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issues its controlled substance schedule in approximately 90 days.

“The approval of OLINVYK marks an exciting step forward in Trevena’s mission of translating cutting-edge scientific discovery into therapeutic benefit for patients in need. I would like to thank all of the patients, investigators, and our employees who helped us achieve this important milestone,” said Carrie L. Bourdow, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We will work quickly to bring this novel IV analgesic to patients and healthcare providers in need of alternative treatment options.”

Each year, approximately 45 million hospital patients in the United States receive an IV opioid to treat their acute pain. Many of these patients are complex and difficult to treat, such as the elderly, obese, or renally-impaired. Current hospital trends suggest that the number of these complex patients is growing, representing an increasing burden on the healthcare system.

OLINVYK is an opioid agonist that is the first new chemical entity in this IV drug class in decades and offers a differentiated profile that addresses a significant unmet need in the acute pain management landscape. OLINVYK delivers IV opioid efficacy with a rapid 2-5 minute onset of action. In addition, OLINVYK requires no dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment, a large patient population with significant medical complications.

The FDA approval of OLINVYK was based on results from the Phase 3 development program, which evaluated OLINVYK in over 1,500 patients with moderate to severe acute pain. In two pivotal efficacy studies in hard- and soft-tissue surgical models, OLINVYK demonstrated rapid analgesic efficacy statistically significant vs. placebo. In a large, open-label, “real world” safety study, OLINVYK was safe and well-tolerated in a medically complex patient population, including the elderly, obese, and patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and sleep apnea.

“Complex patients present unique challenges in the management of their postoperative acute pain, due to the presence of medical comorbidities that can complicate dosing,” said Gregory Hammer, M.D., Professor of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, and of Pediatrics at Stanford University. “OLINVYK represents a new alternative for clinicians, due to its rapid onset of action, effective pain relief, and unique profile.”

The Company expects to make OLINVYK available in the fourth quarter of 2020 following scheduling by the DEA, which may take up to 90 days. The Company is committed to an ethical and responsible marketing campaign for OLINVYK and will have safeguards in place to monitor for and mitigate the risk of non-medical uses of OLINVYK.

The Company also today announced $54.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020, which the Company expects will be sufficient to fund operating expenses, including the commercialization of OLINVYK, through year-end 2021.

OLINVYK Efficacy and Safety Data

The efficacy of OLINVYK was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and morphine-controlled studies which enrolled 790 patients with moderate to severe acute pain (pain intensity of ≥4 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale) after orthopedic surgery-bunionectomy or plastic surgery-abdominoplasty.

In each study, patients were randomized to one of three OLINVYK treatment regimens, a placebo-control regimen, or a morphine-control regimen. The loading dose for all OLINVYK treatment regimens was 1.5 mg; demand doses were 0.1, 0.35, or 0.5 mg, according to the assigned treatment group; supplemental doses were 0.75 mg. A lockout interval of 6 minutes was used for all PCA regimens. Etodolac 200 mg was available as rescue medication. Patients using the approved OLINVYK doses of 0.35 and 0.5 mg had a statistically significantly greater SPID-48/24 than patients using placebo.

The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) in these controlled trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus, and hypoxia. When stratified by the 27 mg daily dosing limit, discontinuation of OLINVYK due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients who received a daily dose ≤27 mg, and less than 1% of patients who received a daily dose >27 mg.

In an open-label safety study of patients with moderate to severe acute pain following a surgical procedure or due to a medical condition, a total of 768 patients received at least one dose of OLINVYK. OLINVYK was administered via clinician-administered bolus dosing, PCA, or a combination of the two. Bolus dosing was initiated at 1 to 2 mg, with supplemental doses of 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours, as needed, based on individual patient need and previous response to OLINVYK. If OLINVYK was administered via PCA, the loading dose was 1.5 mg, the demand dose was 0.5 mg, and the lockout interval was 6 minutes. Supplemental doses of 1 mg were given as needed, taking into account the patient’s utilization of PCA demand doses, individual patient need, and previous response to OLINVYK.

The most frequent condition treated in the open-label safety study was postsurgical acute pain, and  included (in order of decreasing frequency): orthopedic, gynecologic, colorectal, general, plastic, urologic, neurologic (including spinal), bariatric, and cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Of the 768 patients treated with OLINVYK, 32% were age 65 years or older and 78% had a Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2. OLINVYK was administered as needed; 55% of patients received OLINVYK via clinician bolus administration only, and 45% of patients received OLINVYK via PCA self-administration or a combination of clinician bolus- and PCA self-administration. Discontinuation of OLINVYK in this study due to adverse drug reactions occurred in 3% of patients who received a daily dose ≤27 mg and 1% of patients who received a daily dose >27 mg.

Full Prescribing Information, including the Boxed Warning, is available at www.OLINVYK.com.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) DEPRESSANTS

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

OLINVYK exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk before prescribing OLINVYK, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of behaviors or conditions.

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OLINVYK.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of OLINVYK or following a dose increase.

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Prolonged use of OLINVYK during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.

Risk From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

OLINVYK is a new chemical entity indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve OLINVYK for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]:

Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated
Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.
The cumulative total daily dose should not exceed 27 mg, as total daily doses greater than 27 mg may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

OLINVYK is contraindicated in patients with:

Significant respiratory depression
Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment
Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus
Known hypersensitivity to oliceridine (e.g., anaphylaxis)
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

OLINVYK contains oliceridine, a Schedule [controlled substance schedule pending], that exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OLINVYK. Assess risk, counsel, and monitor all patients receiving opioids.
Serious, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended, especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, or in elderly, cachectic and debilitated patients. The risk is greatest during initiation of OLINVYK therapy, following a dose increase, or when used with other drugs that depress respiration. Proper dosing of OLINVYK is essential, especially when converting patients from another opioid product to avoid overdose. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status.
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia with risk increasing in a dose-dependent fashion.  In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the dose of opioid using best practices for opioid taper.
Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate that can be life‑threatening. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using OLINVYK for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OLINVYK with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, or alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate, prescribe the lowest effective dose, and minimize the duration.
OLINVYK was shown to have mild QTc interval prolongation in thorough QT studies where patients were dosed up to 27 mg. Total cumulative daily doses exceeding 27 mg per day were not studied and may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, the cumulative total daily dose of OLINVYK should not exceed 27 mg.
Increased plasma concentrations of OLINVYK may occur in patients with decreased Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 function or normal metabolizers taking moderate or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors; also in patients taking a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in patients with decreased CYP2D6 function who are also receiving a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, or with discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer. These patients may require less frequent dosing and should be closely monitored for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. Concomitant use of OLINVYK with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can lower the expected concentration, which may decrease efficacy, and may require supplemental doses.
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use (usually greater than one month). Presentation and symptoms may be nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If confirmed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids and wean patient from the opioid.
OLINVYK may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics).   Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension.  In patients with circulatory shock, avoid the use of OLINVYK as it may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.
Avoid the use of OLINVYK in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.  OLINVYK should be used with caution in patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors, as a reduction in respiratory drive and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy.
As with all opioids, OLINVYK may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.
OLINVYK may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures in vulnerable patients.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control.
Do not abruptly discontinue OLINVYK in a patient physically dependent on opioids.  Gradually taper the dosage to avoid a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving OLINVYK, as they may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
OLINVYK may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.
Although self-administration of opioids by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) may allow each patient to individually titrate to an acceptable level of analgesia, PCA administration has resulted in adverse outcomes and episodes of respiratory depression. Health care providers and family members monitoring patients receiving PCA analgesia should be instructed in the need for appropriate monitoring for excessive sedation, respiratory depression, or other adverse effects of opioid medications.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Prescribing Information.

The most common (incidence ≥10%) adverse reactions in Phase 3 controlled clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus, and hypoxia.

 Result: Winlevi demonstrated treatment success and reductions in acne lesions and was well tolerated when used q2w (in pivotal clinical trials). Additionally, the most frequently observed local skin reaction was mild erythema
 Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1%) is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris by limiting sebum production and inflammation. It is expected to be available in the US in early 2021","LAINATE, Italy, Aug. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Cassiopea SpA (SIX: SKIN) today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%) for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older. Notwithstanding acne being the most prevalent skin condition in the U.S. affecting up to 50 million Americans annually1, the last FDA approval of an acne drug with a new mechanism of action (MOA) occurred nearly 40 years ago.

Acne is a multifactorial skin condition, affected by four distinct pathways: excess oil (sebum) production, clogged pores (hyperkeratinization), bacteria growth (C. acnes), and inflammation2. Topical treatment options that target androgens, which largely drive sebum production and inflammation, presented a significant unmet need in the acne treatment market until now.

“The approval of WINLEVI is an exciting breakthrough in acne treatment. This game-changing topical drug offers a non-antibiotic approach to people with acne, by targeting the androgen receptors directly in the skin. It fills a longstanding gap in acne therapy,” said Michael Gold, M.D., Investigator and Medical Director, Gold Skin Care Center and Tennessee Clinical Research Center. “After 40 years, it provides a much-anticipated, complementary new approach to treat acne.”

Cassiopea’s first-in-class topical androgen receptor inhibitor, WINLEVI, tackles the androgen hormone component of acne in both males and females. Androgen receptor inhibitors act by limiting the effects of these hormones on increasing sebum production and inflammation3.

In pivotal clinical trials, WINLEVI demonstrated treatment success and reductions in acne lesions and was well tolerated when used twice a day. The most frequently observed local skin reaction was mild erythema4,5.

Diana Harbort, CEO of Cassiopea, said: “This milestone approval marks the introduction of a new class of topical medication in Dermatology. Dermatologists have said targeting androgen hormonal activity in the skin is ‘the holy grail’ of acne treatment for both males and females. We are proud to bring this new innovation to acne patients. This approval rewards many years of hard work and positions Cassiopea as a leader in Dermatology. Now we look forward to expanding our franchise and advancing our next investigational drug candidate for androgenetic alopecia.”

WINLEVI is expected to be available in the United States in early 2021. Complete prescribing information is available on www.WINLEVI.com.

About Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%):

Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%) is approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris in people aged 12 and older. Although WINLEVI’s exact mechanism of action is unknown, laboratory studies suggest the active ingredient, clascoterone, competes with androgens, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), for binding to the androgen receptors within the sebaceous gland and hair follicles6.

Indication

Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%), is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.

Important Safety Information

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
None.

WARNINGS
Local Irritation: Pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling may be experienced with WINLEVI cream. If these effects occur, discontinue or reduce the frequency of application of WINLEVI cream.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur during or after treatment with WINLEVI. In the PK trial, HPA axis suppression was observed in 1/20 (5%) of adult subjects and 2/22 (9%) of adolescent subjects at Day 14. All subjects returned to normal HPA axis function at follow-up 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Attempt to withdraw use if HPA axis suppression develops.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.

Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels were observed in some subjects during the clinical trials. Shifts from normal to elevated potassium levels were observed in 5% of WINLEVI-treated subjects and 4% of vehicle-treated subjects.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions occurring in 7 to 12% of patients are erythema/reddening, pruritus and scaling/dryness. Additionally, edema, stinging, and burning occurred in >3% of patients and were reported in a similar percentage of subjects treated with vehicle.

 Result: P-III study showed 40 % reduction in the IVCM total score across all corneal layers from baseline to 90 days and P-I/IIa study demonstrated a 30 % decrease in IVCM total score that was maintained for the 5 year study period
 Cystadrops (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) 0.37% is a cystine-depleting agent indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children with cystinosis. It is the 1st and only FDA-approved cysteamine eye drop formulation","LEBANON, N.J., Aug. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Recordati Rare Diseases Inc., today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved CYSTADROPS® (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) 0.37%. CYSTADROPS is a new, viscous eye drop solution that depletes corneal cystine crystal deposits in people living with cystinosis. CYSTADROPS demonstrated a significant reduction in cystine crystal deposits in the cornea of the eye and is the first and only FDA-approved cysteamine drop formulation with four times a day dosing. Cystinosis is a rare genetic condition present from birth that leads to the build-up of cystine crystals throughout the body, causing widespread tissue and organ damage and significant impact on the eyes.

“Cystinosis is a complex disease and early detection and prompt treatment are critical in slowing the development and progression of symptoms. Improvements in the treatment of cystinosis in the last few decades has led to increased life expectancies. Despite these advances, eye manifestations of the disease are a continual struggle for patients,” said Clinton Moore, President, Cystinosis Research Network. “Cystinosis patients live with sensitivity to light, eye discomfort, and pain. They often wear sunglasses even when indoors and fight to keep up with daily activities like school and work.”

The FDA approval of CYSTADROPS was supported by data from two clinical trials, both in which patients received CYSTADROPS at a median frequency of four times per day. A Phase 3 open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multicenter trial, with 15 patients in the CYSTADROPS arm, investigated the reduction in corneal cystine crystal density as assessed by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). In the CYSTADROPS arm, the trial showed a 40 percent reduction in the IVCM total score across all corneal layers from baseline to 90 days.

A Phase 1/2a open-label, adaptive dose-response clinical trial of eight cystinosis patients showed that treatment with CYSTADROPS resulted in a 30 percent decrease in IVCM total score that was maintained for the five-year study period.

“People living with cystinosis and their caregivers have to manage multiple medications every day. To reduce their daily burden, Recordati worked to develop a new viscous eye drop formulation for treating corneal cystine crystals,” said Andrea Recordati, CEO. “We are pleased to bring Cystadrops® to patients in the U.S., the first FDA-approved cysteamine eye drop formulation that reduces corneal crystals with a practical four times a day dosing.”

The safety of CYSTADROPS was evaluated in two clinical trials. The most commonly observed adverse reactions were eye pain (stinging), blurred vision, eye irritation (burning), eye redness, discomfort at instillation site (sticky eyes or sticky eyelids), eye itching, watery eyes, and medicine deposit on the eye lashes or around the eyes.

About Cystinosis
Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder affecting multiple organs and systems that most frequently begins in infancy. Cystinosis requires patients and caregivers to manage multiple different medications every day. It is estimated that approximately 600 people in the U.S. have cystinosis. Cystinosis is caused by a mutation in the cystinosin gene (CTNS) that impairs the transport of the amino acid cystine out of lysosomes in cells. This, in turn, results in formation and accumulation of cystine crystals in cells, causing damage to organs throughout the body and significant impact on the eyes.

The cornea, or front layer of the eye, is the part of the eye that may be most affected. The first and most frequently reported ocular symptom is photophobia — sensitivity to light that results in discomfort. It is thought that photophobia is mainly due to the presence of corneal cystine crystals that cause light entering the eye to scatter. As the disease progresses, ocular symptoms increase in number and intensity, daily activities become more difficult to carry out, and severe complications may develop, including visual impairment and potential corneal transplant.

48689,Innocoll's Xaracoll (bupivacaine HCl) Receives the US FDA's Approval for the Acute Postsurgical Pain Relief in Adults Following Open Inguinal Hernia Repair,"FDA Approves XARACOLL® (bupivacaine HCl) Implant, a Non-opioid, Drug-device Treatment Option for Acute Postsurgical Pain Relief for up to 24 Hours Following Open Inguinal Hernia Repair in Adults","The approval is based on two P-III study (N=610, XARACOLL Arm N=404; PBO Arm N=206) performed as outpatient surgeries in adults across 39 sites in the US.
 Result: Xaracoll provided statistically significant pain relief through 24 hrs. vs PBO, the primary endpoint for both studies. Median time in study 1 (11hrs. vs 1 hrs.) and in study 2 (6hrs. vs 1 hrs.)
 Xaracoll is a unique, non-injectable drug-device combination in the form of a fully bioresorbable collagen implant containing bupivacaine hydrochloride which is placed directly into the surgical site during surgery and, after placement, releases bupivacaine immediately and over time","ATHLONE, Ireland, Aug. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innocoll Holdings Limited, a specialty pharmaceutical company and portfolio business of Gurnet Point Capital, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Xaracoll®  for acute postsurgical pain relief for up to 24 hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair, a painful and commonly-performed surgery.1

XARACOLL is a unique, non-injectable drug-device combination in the form of a fully bioresorbable collagen implant containing bupivacaine hydrochloride. XARACOLL is placed directly into the surgical site during surgery and, after placement, releases bupivacaine immediately and over time.1,2

“XARACOLL is an advancement in the management of postsurgical pain as it is the first and only drug-device combination product to provide local pain relief following open inguinal hernia repair in adults,” said Innocoll CEO Rich Fante. “The FDA approval is an important milestone for Innocoll and we are excited to bring XARACOLL to market later this year as an effective and well-tolerated, non-opioid treatment option for surgeons.”

The efficacy and safety of XARACOLL was evaluated in two Phase III studies of identical design in open inguinal hernia repair. The Phase III studies were performed as outpatient surgeries in adults across 39 sites (N=610, XARACOLL Arm N=404, Placebo Arm N=206) in the US. XARACOLL provided statistically significant pain relief through 24 hours versus placebo, the primary endpoint for both studies. The first secondary endpoint of total use of opioid analgesia through 24 hours was also statistically significant. Additionally, the proportion of patients who did not receive opioid rescue analgesia through 72 hours in the XARACOLL and placebo treatment groups was 36% and 22%, respectively, in Study 1, and 28% and 12%, respectively, in Study 2.  The median time to first opioid rescue analgesia in the XARACOLL and placebo treatment groups was 11 hours and 1 hour, respectively, in Study 1, and 6 hours and 1 hour, respectively in Study 2. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (incidence ≥2% and higher than placebo) included incision site swelling, dysgeusia, headache, tremor, blurred vision, seroma, scrotal swelling, pyrexia, oral hypoesthesia, and post procedural discharge.1,3

“In Phase III studies XARACOLL was shown to provide local pain relief in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair while also decreasing the amount of opioids needed,” said Wendy Niebler DO, MBA, Chief Medical Officer at Innocoll. “We look forward to sharing our Phase III data with surgeons as we introduce this new option to manage acute pain following open inguinal hernia repair in adults.”

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

XARACOLL contains an amide local anesthetic and is indicated in adults for placement into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia for up to 24 hours following open inguinal hernia repair.

Limitations of Use

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in other surgical procedures, including orthopedic and boney procedures.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

XARACOLL is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bupvicaine or to any local anesthetic of the amide type or other components of XARACOLL, in addition to use in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. Cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and consciousness should monitored after placement of XARACOLL, especially in patients with hepatic impairment. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with use of local anesthetics. Additional anesthetic administration should be avoided within 96 hours following XARACOLL implantation. Local anesthetics may cause fetal harm based on animal data.

48692,GSK's Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) Receives the US FDA's Approval as a Monotherapy Treatment for Multiple Myeloma,FDA approves GSK’s BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma,"The approval is based on a pivotal study, DREAMM-2 assessing Blenrep (2.5 mg/kg, q3w) in 218 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had actively progressing disease that had worsened despite current SoC
 Results: Blenrep demonstrated an ORR (31%), DoR not reached at the 6-mos. analysis, but 73% of responders had a DoR ≥ 6 mos. Continued approval for this indication depends upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials
 Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F. Blenrep is the 1st anti-BCMA therapy approved globally and 5th major medicine approval for GSK in 2020","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. BLENREP is the first anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapy approved anywhere in the world.[i]

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “As the second most common form of blood cancer in the US, multiple myeloma is an incurable and devastating disease. BLENREP is the first approved anti-BCMA therapy and has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have limited treatment options today.’’

BLENREP is GSK’s fifth major medicine approval in 2020 across areas of significant unmet medical need such as cancer, HIV and chronic kidney disease. This approval marks the second FDA approval for GSK’s oncology portfolio in four months.

BLENREP employs a multi-faceted mechanism of action and is directed toward BCMA, a cell-surface protein that plays an important role in the survival of plasma cells and is expressed on multiple myeloma cells.[ii] The approval of BLENREP was based on six-month primary results from the pivotal DREAMM-2 study, which enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had actively progressing disease that had worsened despite current standard of care.

Dr Sagar Lonial, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, Chair of Emory Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Principal Investigator for DREAMM-2, said: “While treatable, refractory multiple myeloma is a significant clinical challenge with poor outcomes for patients whose disease has become resistant to the current standard of care. Due to the limited options currently available, these patients are often retreated with drugs from the same classes after they relapse, which is why the approval of BLENREP, the first anti-BCMA therapy, is significant for both patients and physicians alike.”

In the DREAMM-2 study, treatment with single-agent BLENREP 2.5 mg/kg every three weeks demonstrated a clinically meaningful overall response rate (ORR) of 31% (97.5% CI; 21-43) in patients who had received a median of seven prior lines of treatment (n=97). The median duration of response (DoR) had not been reached at the six-month analysis, but 73% of responders had a DoR equal to or greater than six months. The most commonly reported adverse events (≥20%) were keratopathy, decreased visual acuity, nausea, blurred vision, pyrexia, infusion-related reactions, and fatigue. Keratopathy is characterised as changes in the corneal epithelium as seen on eye examination, which can manifest with or without symptoms.

Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 77% of the 218 patients in the pooled safety population and included keratopathy (76%), changes in visual acuity (55%), blurred vision (27%) and dry eye (19%). Corneal adverse events were monitored with eye exams prior to each dose, allowing for dose reductions or interruptions as appropriate. Patients also used preservative-free eye drops. Keratopathy leading to treatment discontinuation affected 2.1% of patients in the 2.5 mg/kg cohort.[iii]

BLENREP is available through participation in the BLENREP Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which was developed to ensure appropriate use of the medicine. The programme requires education for all physicians prescribing BLENREP and their patients regarding the ocular risks associated with treatment as well as monitoring. Additional information about the BLENREP REMS can be found at www.blenreprems.com or 1-855-209-9188.

Paul Giusti, President and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), said: “The approval of BLENREP is an important advancement for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, as it brings a much-needed new treatment to patients who face limited options due to their progressing disease. We are grateful for GSK’s continued commitment to myeloma patients and their families.”

In 2017, BLENREP was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, which is intended to facilitate the development of investigational medicines that have shown clinical promise for conditions where there is significant unmet need.

About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the US and is generally considered treatable, but not curable.[iv] In the US, more than 32,000 people are estimated to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma this year and nearly 13,000 people will die from the disease.[v] Research into new therapies is needed as multiple myeloma commonly becomes refractory to available treatments.[vi]

About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)
The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.iii

About BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf)
BLENREP is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BLENREP

WARNING: OCULAR Toxicity
BLENREP caused changes in the corneal epithelium resulting in changes in vision, including severe vision loss and corneal ulcer, and symptoms such as blurred vision and dry eyes.

Conduct ophthalmic exams at baseline, prior to each dose, and promptly for worsening symptoms. Withhold BLENREP until improvement and resume, or permanently discontinue, based on severity.

Because of the risk of ocular toxicity, BLENREP is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BLENREP REMS.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Ocular Toxicity: Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 77% of the 218 patients in the pooled safety population. Ocular adverse reactions included keratopathy (76%), changes in visual acuity (55%), blurred vision (27%), and dry eye (19%). Among patients with keratopathy (n = 165), 49% had ocular symptoms, 65% had clinically relevant visual acuity changes (decline of 2 or more lines on Snellen Visual Acuity in any eye), and 34% had both ocular symptoms and visual acuity changes.

Keratopathy: Keratopathy was reported as Grade 1 in 7% of patients, Grade 2 in 22%, Grade 3 in 45%, and Grade 4 in 0.5% per the KVA scale. Cases of corneal ulcer (ulcerative and infective keratitis) have been reported. Most keratopathy events developed within the first 2 treatment cycles (cumulative incidence of 65% by Cycle 2). Of the patients with Grade 2 to 4 keratopathy (n = 149), 39% recovered to Grade 1 or lower after median follow-up of 6.2 months. Of the 61% who had ongoing keratopathy, 28% were still on treatment, 9% were in follow-up, and in 24% the follow-up ended due to death, study withdrawal, or lost to follow-up. For patients in whom events resolved, the median time to resolution was 2 months (range: 11 days to 8.3 months).

Visual Acuity Changes: A clinically significant decrease in visual acuity of worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye was observed in 19% of the 218 patients and of 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye in 1.4%. Of the patients with decreased visual acuity of worse than 20/40, 88% resolved and the median time to resolution was 22 days (range: 7 days to 4.2 months). Of the patients with decreased visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, all resolved and the median duration was 22 days (range: 15 to 22 days).

Monitoring and Patient Instruction: Conduct ophthalmic examinations (visual acuity and slit lamp) at baseline, prior to each dose, and promptly for worsening symptoms. Perform baseline examinations within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. Perform each follow-up examination at least 1 week after the previous dose and within 2 weeks prior to the next dose. Withhold BLENREP until improvement and resume at same or reduced dose, or consider permanently discontinuing based on severity. Advise patients to use preservative-free lubricant eye drops at least 4 times a day starting with the first infusion and continuing until end of treatment. Avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an ophthalmologist. Changes in visual acuity may be associated with difficulty for driving and reading. Advise patients to use caution when driving or operating machinery. BLENREP is only available through a restricted program under a REMS.

BLENREP REMS: BLENREP is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the BLENREP REMS because of the risks of ocular toxicity. Notable requirements of the BLENREP REMS include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training in the BLENREP REMS.
Prescribers must counsel patients receiving BLENREP about the risk of ocular toxicity and the need for ophthalmic examinations prior to each dose.
Patients must be enrolled in the BLENREP REMS and comply with monitoring.
Healthcare facilities must be certified with the program and verify that patients are authorized to receive BLENREP.
Wholesalers and distributers must only distribute BLENREP to certified healthcare facilities.
Further information is available at www.BLENREPREMS.com and 1-855-209-9188.

Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 69% of 218 patients in the pooled safety population, including Grade 2 in 13%, Grade 3 in 10%, and Grade 4 in 17%. The median time to onset of the first thrombocytopenic event was 26.5 days. Thrombocytopenia resulted in dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinuation in 9%, 2.8%, and 0.5% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 bleeding events occurred in 6% of patients, including Grade 4 in 1 patient. Fatal adverse reactions included cerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. Perform complete blood cell counts at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding and/or reducing the dose based on severity.

Infusion-Related Reactions: Infusion-related reactions occurred in 18% of 218 patients in the pooled safety population, including Grade 3 in 1.8%. Monitor patients for infusion-related reactions. For Grade 2 or 3 reactions, interrupt the infusion and provide supportive treatment. Once symptoms resolve, resume at a lower infusion rate. Administer premedication for all subsequent infusions. Discontinue BLENREP for life-threatening infusion-related reactions and provide appropriate emergency care.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action, BLENREP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it contains a genotoxic compound (the microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin F [MMAF]) and it targets actively dividing cells. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BLENREP and for 4 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BLENREP and for 6 months after the last dose.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
The pooled safety population described in Warnings and Precautions reflects exposure to BLENREP at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg (1.4 times the recommended dose) administered intravenously once every 3 weeks in 218 patients in DREAMM-2. Of these patients, 194 received a liquid formulation (not the approved dosage form) rather than the lyophilized powder. Among the 218 patients, 24% were exposed for 6 months or longer.

The safety of BLENREP as a single agent was evaluated in DREAMM-2. Patients received BLENREP at the recommended dosage of 2.5 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 95). Among these patients, 22% were exposed for 6 months or longer.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients who received BLENREP. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included pneumonia (7%), pyrexia (6%), renal impairment (4.2%), sepsis (4.2%), hypercalcemia (4.2%), and infusion-related reactions (3.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including sepsis (1%), cardiac arrest (1%), and lung infection (1%).

Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients who received BLENREP; keratopathy (2.1%) was the most frequent adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation.

Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 54% of patients who received BLENREP. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption in >3% of patients included keratopathy (47%), blurred vision (5%), dry eye (3.2%), and pneumonia (3.2%).

Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in >3% of patients included keratopathy (23%) and thrombocytopenia (5%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were keratopathy (71%), decreased visual acuity (53%), nausea (24%), blurred vision (22%), pyrexia (22%), infusion-related reactions (21%), and fatigue (20%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 (≥5%) laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytes decreased (22%), platelets decreased (21%), hemoglobin decreased (18%), neutrophils decreased (9%), creatinine increased (5%), and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (5%).

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Lactation: There is no data on the presence of belantamab mafodotin-blmf in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BLENREP and for 3 months after the last dose.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: BLENREP can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no available data on the use of BLENREP in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk. No animal reproduction studies were conducted with BLENREP.

Pregnancy Testing: Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BLENREP.

Infertility: Based on findings in animal studies, BLENREP may impair fertility in females and males. The effects were not reversible in male rats but were reversible in female rats.

Geriatric Use: Of the 218 patients who received BLENREP in DREAMM-2, 43% were aged 65 to less than 75 years and 17% were aged 75 years and older. Keratopathy occurred in 80% of patients aged less than 65 years and 73% of patients aged 65 years and older. Among the patients who received BLENREP at the 2.5-mg/kg dose in DREAMM-2 (n = 95), keratopathy occurred in 67% of patients aged less than 65 years and 73% of patients aged 65 years and older.

Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation). The recommended dosage has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 not on dialysis or requiring dialysis.

Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN or total bilirubin 1 to ≤1.5 × ULN and any AST). The recommended dosage of BLENREP has not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN and any AST).

INDICATION
BLENREP is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 4 prior therapies, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

AstraZeneca to get the rights to an orally active drug inhibiting PCSK9, offering a patient-friendly alternative to current cholesterol-lowering therapies that are delivered via a needle
 The agreement allows the AstraZeneca to develop the first small molecule, orally bioavailable PCSK9 inhibitor for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease
 PCSK9 is considered the exemplary target accredited by human genetics, as variants found in humans establish the needed directionality of a therapeutic","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Dogma Therapeutics (“Dogma“) has reached an agreement for the acquisition of its oral PCSK9 program by AstraZeneca.  Dogma will receive upfront as well as downstream payments linked to global regulatory and commercial milestones.

The pursuit of a convenient, oral PCSK9-based therapy has been the singular focus of Dogma scientists for nearly a decade.  PCSK9 is widely considered the exemplary target accredited by human genetics, as variants found in humans establish the needed directionality of a therapeutic.  Both from a patient convenience standpoint and the potential for combination therapy, there is a need for widely-accessible oral therapies for the millions of people at risk for cardiovascular events.

Through a series of comprehensive hit-finding and validation efforts, the Dogma team discovered small molecules that directly bind to a novel binding pocket in PCSK9.  Dozens of high-resolution x-ray structures of Dogma inhibitors bound to PCSK9 allowed rapid optimization to picomolar affinity with exquisite physicochemical attributes and robust LDL-C lowering when dosed orally in preclinical models of hypercholesterolemia.

“We have built a robust data package that highlights the cholesterol-lowering and safety potential of our oral PCSK9 program,” noted Dogma CEO Brian Hubbard, Ph.D.  “This agreement with AstraZeneca meets our strategic goal to accelerate access to patients unable to meet target LDL-C.  I would like to especially thank our scientific partners – Charles River Laboratories, Viva Biotech, Anji Pharmaceuticals, and our CRO partners – for their commitment to this project and their world-class problem solving.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said: “Raised LDL cholesterol is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths worldwide every year. Whilst PCSK9 is a well validated target for lowering LDL cholesterol it has been a hugely challenging target to inhibit with small molecules. This agreement with Dogma Therapeutics offers us the opportunity to develop the first small molecule, orally bioavailable PCSK9 inhibitor, for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.”

Since inception, Dogma has developed a highly collaborative research model that leverages scientific expertise across the globe. This collaborative model was first created with Charles River, a leading, full-service drug discovery and early-stage development company, who, with its global, integrated drug discovery and safety assessment platform, has worked on 85% of drugs approved by the FDA in 2019. In tackling this previously considered ‘small molecule undruggable’ target, Charles River scientists and project leads contributed medicinal and computational chemistry, structural biology, biophysics, cell biology, ADME, and PK/PD expertise. “Charles River has played an integral role in the launch and progression of Dogma with their compelling drug discovery expertise and knowledge,” noted Hubbard.

“Our team is extremely proud to have worked closely with Dogma throughout the development of its oral PCSK9 inhibitor program,” said Birgit Girshick, Executive Vice President, Discovery & Safety Assessment at Charles River. “This ground-breaking project could prove transformational in the management of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease.”

Another key partner, Viva Biotech, is a leading structure-based, integrated drug discovery platform company. Viva has a full spectrum of early-stage drug discovery technologies from hit identification to development candidate nomination, combined with a unique equity-for-service (EFS) model. Viva has incubated more than 50 startup biotech companies similar to Dogma and plans to work with 100 more in the next 2 years.

“It was an exceptionally rewarding experience for our team to have a close partnership with Dogma during the exciting discovery phase,” said Dr. Zhixiong Ye, Chief Scientific Officer at Viva Biotech. “An orally-bioavailable small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor will greatly impact the unmet medical needs of cardiovascular patients.”

In addition to Viva’s equity-for-service investment, Dogma received support from a syndicate of cross-border investors and corporate collaborators including JMCR Partners, CR Capital, and Anji Pharmaceuticals.

The Foley Hoag LLP team of Hemmie Chang, Adrienne Ellman, David Halstead, Nicola Lemay, Kathryn Lumb, Laura Trumbull, Yuliya Kozachenko, Chasse Osborn and Kyrsten Lundh represented Dogma.

 Using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2 S Ab test together with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test-launched in May’2020, can aid effectively in determining the percentage of a population who already have Abs against SARS-COV-2","The new Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test can quantitatively measure the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients who have been exposed to the virus.
The test  targets antibodies against the spike protein. This is the focus of vaccines in development and convalescent plasma therapy.1
Using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-COV-2 S antibody test, together with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2* test launched in May, can help to more effectively determine the percentage of a population who already have antibodies against SARS-COV-2.

Basel, 18 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test for markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche has filed for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test can be used to quantitatively measure antibodies in people who have been exposed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can play an important part in characterising a vaccine-induced immune response.1 Specifically, the test targets antibodies which are directed against the particular region of the viral spike protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, which is required for the virus to enter the host cell. The majority of current candidate vaccines aim to induce an antibody response against the spike protein.

“As the possibility of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes a reality, quantitative measurement of antibodies will be crucial in the evaluation of any potential vaccine. The new quantitative Elecsys antibody test can play a pivotal role in vaccine clinical trials as well as helping clinicians assess patients immune response.This will be instrumental in protecting people most vulnerable to the virus, as well as in overcoming COVID-19 for society in general.” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This new test, the twelfth in the Roche SARS-CoV-2 testing portfolio, is another essential addition to support healthcare systems and patients as we jointly fight COVID-19.”

Before a vaccine is administered it is important to know the starting level of antibodies a person has, in order to evaluate any change in antibody levels that the vaccine induces, especially the development of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These antibodies have been shown to have potent antiviral activity and correlate to potential immunity.2 Measuring antibody levels could also be vital in establishing vaccine efficacy in the prevention of infection and/or the development of severe COVID-19.1

Alongside its importance to vaccine design and efficacy evaluations, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S serology test can be used to determine antibody levels in plasmapheresis donations. Performing a combination of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests can also help to more effectively define what percentage of a given population has developed antibodies (seroprevalence) against SARS-COV-2, especially in low to moderate seroprevalence settings.3 Knowing a given population’s seroprevalence is important in understanding how to contain the spread of the virus, as well as how to safely ease lockdown restrictions.

The test is the latest addition to the comprehensive Roche diagnostic portfolio to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the point of care. Currently, this portfolio includes molecular, serology and digital solutions which help diagnose and manage COVID-19 during the initial stages of infection, during the recovery phase, as well as following the resolution of infection.

About SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.4

About potential SARS-COV-2 vaccines
As of 3 September  2020, 47 candidate vaccines are in clinical evaluation and 3 vaccines have been approved for early or limited use, while at least 91 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation.1,5 All candidate vaccines in Phase III or approved for limited / early use aim to induce an antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Any potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work (amongst other mechanisms) by triggering the immune response to develop neutralising antibodies, in the person receiving the vaccine. In doing so, the vaccine trains the body’s immune system to recognize and fight an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in a controlled way, without being exposed to the actual virus.1

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology tests
The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S is an immunoassay for the quantitative, in vitro determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can measure the quantity of antibodies to the spike protein of the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This can also be used to determine antibody levels in plasmapheresis donations. Plasmapheresis is a procedure which separates and removes the plasma from a patient’s blood. This plasma is then replaced with plasma from a donor.  It is assumed that plasma from a donor who has already had SARS-CoV-2 will have direct antiviral properties for the donor recipient.6 This is being explored as an adjunctive treatment for the management of COVID-19.6 The test has both a high clinical specificity of 99.98% (N=5991) and sensitivity of 98.8% (N=1423), 14 days or later after diagnosis with PCR. Additionally, across panels of potentially cross-reactive samples (N=1100) from endemic human coronaviruses, infectious respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, auto-immune and liver related diseases, the test demonstrated zero cross-reactivity.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analyzers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyzer.3

*The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the qualitative, in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2. The test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. This test can also help in the determination of seroprevalence (i.e. the frequency of individuals with antibody to the virus), in a given population, as well as a complement test to Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test runs on Roche’s cobas e analyzers which are widely available around the world.3

About Roche response to COVID-19 section
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment,
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as distribution partner, to our portfolio, that allows the detection of antibodies against Covid-19 at the point of care. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

Five-year follow-up data from the SOLO-1 Phase III trial showed Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.43) and improved PFS to a median of 56.0 months versus 13.8 months for placebo. At five years, 48.3% of patients treated with Lynparza remained free from disease progression versus 20.5% on placebo. The median duration of treatment with Lynparza was 24.6 months versus 13.9 months with placebo.

Susana Banerjee, one of the investigators from the SOLO-1 trial and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Reader at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: “For patients with newly-diagnosed BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, the benefit derived from two years of maintenance treatment with Lynparza continued long after treatment ended. After five years, almost half of women were free of cancer progression. These results represent a significant step forward in the treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Once a patient’s ovarian cancer recurs, it historically has been incurable. Even at an advanced stage, we have shown that maintenance treatment with Lynparza can help patients achieve sustained remission. Today’s results further underline the critical importance of identifying a patient’s biomarker status at the time of diagnosis to offer a treatment that may help delay disease progression.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “This is the first trial of a PARP inhibitor to read out a five year follow up and showed Lynparza improved progression-free survival to over four and half years versus 13.8 months with placebo following response to 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. This latest data represents a major and significant milestone in a disease which has historically had such a poor prognosis.”
Summary of results

summary of results
The safety profile of Lynparza was consistent with previous observations. The most common adverse events (AEs) ≥20% were nausea (77%), fatigue/asthenia (63%), vomiting (40%), anaemia (39%) and diarrhoea (34%). The most common ≥ grade 3 AEs were anaemia (22%) and neutropenia (9%). 12% of patients on Lynparza discontinued treatment due to an AE.

The results were presented on Friday 18 September during the 2020 European Society of Medical Oncology virtual congress.

The SOLO-1 Phase III trial met the primary endpoint of PFS in June 2018, which formed the basis of approvals in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries.

Ovarian cancer

For newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of first-line treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible and maintain the patient’s quality of life with the intent of achieving complete remission.3-6

About SOLO-1

SOLO-1 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as a maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in patients with newly-diagnosed BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The trial randomised 391 patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were in clinical complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy.

Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive Lynparza or placebo for up to two years or until disease progression. Patients who had a partial response at two years were permitted to stay on therapy at the investigator’s discretion. The primary endpoint was PFS and key secondary endpoints included time to second disease progression or death, time to first subsequent treatment and overall survival.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration 

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

Roche plans to share these results with health authorities, including the US FDA

Basel, 18 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the phase III EMPACTA study met its primary endpoint, showing that patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who received Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) plus standard of care were 44% less likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death compared to patients who received placebo plus standard of care (log-rank p-value = 0.0348; HR [95% CI] = 0.56 [0.32, 0.97]). The cumulative proportion of patients who progressed to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28 was 12.2% in the Actemra/RoActemra arm versus 19.3% in the placebo arm. The EMPACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra.

“The EMPACTA trial demonstrated that Actemra/RoActemra can reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, an important outcome in this serious disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We plan to share this important data with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health authorities around the world.”

The study is the first global, phase III COVID-19 clinical trial to primarily enrol patient populations that are often underrepresented in clinical studies and have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 85% of the 389 patients were from minority racial and ethnic groups. The majority of patients were Hispanic, with significant representation of Native American and Black populations. The trial was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico and Peru.

“We have been striving to improve inclusion and diversity in our trials,” said Jamie Freedman, M.D., Ph.D., Head of U.S. Medical Affairs. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw how high the stakes were for many communities of colour and made diversity the centerpiece of this trial.”

The EMPACTA trial builds on Roche’s work in Advancing Inclusive Research, a cross-organisational US initiative to help address barriers in clinical research for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.

Summary of Key EMPACTA Clinical and Safety Findings

Primary endpoint was met: patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who received Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care were 44% less likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death compared to patients who received placebo plus standard of care (log-rank p-value = 0.0348; HR [95% CI] = 0.56 [0.32, 0.97]). The cumulative proportion of patients who progressed to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28 was 12.2% in the Actemra/RoActemra arm versus 19.3% in the placebo arm.
Key secondary endpoints
The difference in time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” to day 28 was not significant (median (days): Actemra = 6; placebo (PBO) = 7.5; log-rank p-value = 0.2456; HR [95% CI] = 1.16 [0.90, 1.48])
The difference in time to improvement in ordinal clinical status to day 28 was not significant (median (days): Actemra = 6; PBO = 7; log-rank p-value = 0.2597; HR  [95% CI] = 1.15 [0.90, 1.47])
Time to clinical failure to day 28 was longer in the Actemra arm compared to the placebo arm (median (days): Actemra = not-estimable (NE); PBO = NE; log-rank p = 0.0217; HR [95% CI] = 0.55 [0.33, 0.92]). However, the difference cannot be considered statistically significant as other key secondary endpoints were not met.
There was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra or placebo by day 28 (Actemra = 10.4%; PBO = 8.6%, p-value = 0.5146, Difference [95% CI]: 2.0% [-5.2%, 7.8%].
At day 28, incidence of infections was 10% and 11% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively, and the incidence of serious infections was 5.0% and 6.3% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively. The most common adverse events in patients who received Actemra/RoActemra were constipation (5.6%), anxiety (5.2%), and headache (3.2%). The EMPACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra.
Results from the EMPACTA trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Actemra/RoActemra is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including in combination with an antiviral in the phase III REMDACTA clinical trial. Results from the phase III COVACTA trial in patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia were released in July. In addition, there are a number of independent trials of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Actemra/RoActemra has not been approved by any health authority for COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

About the EMPACTA Trial
EMPACTA (Evaluating Minority Patients with Actemra) is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study (EMPACTA, NCT04372186) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Actemra in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 associated pneumonia among patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials.

The trial enrolled hospitalised patients older than 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection with SpO2 <94% while on ambient air who did not require noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint is the cumulative proportion of participants dying or requiring mechanical ventilation by Day 28. Secondary objectives include: time to clinical failure, defined as the time to death, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or withdrawal (whichever occurs first); mortality rate by Day 28; and time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge.”

The study enrolled 389 patients in the United States, South Africa, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico and Peru.

About the REMDACTA Trial
REMDACTA is a two-armed global phase III, randomised, double-blind, multi-centre study (REMDACTA, NCT04409262) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra plus remdesivir, versus placebo plus remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia receiving standard of care. The REMDACTA trial is being conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. The primary endpoint of the study is clinical status as measured by a 7-Category Ordinal Scale by Day 28. Key secondary endpoints include mortality, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomisation.

About Actemra/RoActemra
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and in the US and Europe for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC injection is also the first approved therapy for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in more than 40 countries, including the US and Europe. In the US and Europe, Actemra/RoActemra IV injection is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for CRS in this setting. A prefilled auto-injector ACTPen has been approved in the US and Europe. In Japan, Actemra is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s disease, adult Still’s disease and Takayasu arteritis, in addition to the above mentioned indications. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This new test is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In July, we added a Rapid Antibody Test, with SD Biosensor as distribution partner, to our portfolio, that allows the detection of antibodies against Covid-19 at the point of care. On 1 September we announced that we will launch a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, in late September, for markets accepting the CE Mark. We also intend to file for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is for use in point of care settings for both symptomatic and asymptomatic people. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations. On 19 August, we announced a partnership with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic

(75% & 10%) chances of being alive @2yrs.respectively","PACIFIC Phase III trial data at ESMO also showed an estimated 35% of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with IMFINZI® had not progressed after four years

CASPIAN Phase III trial data also at ESMO underscored long-term benefit in a proportion of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer

September 18, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Updated results from the PACIFIC Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI® (durvalumab) demonstrated a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).

One in three patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at Stage III, where the majority of tumors are unresectable (cannot be removed with surgery).1,2 Prior to the approval of IMFINZI in this setting, no new treatments beyond CRT had been available to these patients for decades.3,4,5

The results from the updated post-hoc analyses showed an estimated four-year overall survival rate of 49.6% for IMFINZI versus 36.3% for placebo after CRT. Median OS was 47.5 months for IMFINZI versus 29.1 for placebo. With a maximum treatment course of one year, an estimated 35.3% of patients treated with IMFINZI had not progressed four years after enrollment versus 19.5% for placebo. These data build on The New England Journal of Medicine publication from 2018 demonstrating a significant benefit for IMFINZI in the OS primary endpoint.6

Corinne Faivre-Finn, Professor at The University of Manchester and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and a lead investigator in the PACIFIC Phase III trial, said: “Previously, only 15 to 30 percent of patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer survived five years, and the majority eventually progressed to metastatic disease. These data show about half of patients treated with IMFINZI survived four years, and an estimated 35 percent had not progressed, a remarkable advance in this curative-intent setting.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “These unprecedented four-year results reinforce IMFINZI as the established standard of care in unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and set a new survival benchmark in a setting where cure is the treatment goal. With data also at ESMO for CASPIAN in small cell lung cancer patients, IMFINZI continues to deliver impressive long-term benefits across different types of lung cancer.”

In the primary OS analysis of the PACIFIC Phase III trial, the most common adverse events (AE) (greater than or equal to 20%) among patients treated with IMFINZI versus placebo were cough (35.2% versus 25.2%), fatigue (24.0% versus 20.5%), dyspnea (22.3% versus 23.9%) and radiation pneumonitis (20.2% versus 15.8%). A grade 3 or 4 AE was experienced by 30.5% of patients treated with IMFINZI versus 26.1% for placebo, and 15.4% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs with IMFINZI versus 9.8% for placebo.

CASPIAN Phase III Trial Exploratory Subgroup Analyses in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020

New exploratory subgroup analyses from the CASPIAN Phase III trial of IMFINZI were conducted to characterize patients deriving long-term benefit. More than three times as many patients treated with IMFINZI plus chemotherapy were alive and progression free for one year or more (PFS ≥12 months) versus chemotherapy alone (17% versus 4.5%). Across all treatment arms, the subgroup of patients who were progression free at one year had a 75% chance of being alive at two years. In comparison, the subgroup of patients whose disease had progressed within one year (PFS <12 months) had a 10% chance of being alive at two years. Clinical characteristics did not appear to identify patients who derived long-term benefit.

Patients with PFS ≥12 months received more cycles of IMFINZI treatment compared to patients with PFS <12 months (median of 25 cycles versus 7). Although patients with greater exposure to IMFINZI had numerically higher rates of immune-mediated AEs, the two subgroups had similar rates of severe AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation.

The CASPIAN trial met the primary endpoint of OS in 2019, reducing the risk of death by 27% in patients with ES-SCLC treated with IMFINZI plus a choice of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The safety and tolerability of IMFINZI plus chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. These results were published in The Lancet in 2019 and formed the basis of regulatory approvals around the world.7

Results from the PACIFIC and CASPIAN Phase III trials were presented during the ESMO Virtual Congress on September 19 and September 21, 2020.

Important Safety Information

There are no contraindications for IMFINZI® (durvalumab).

IMFINZI can cause serious, potentially fatal adverse reactions including immune-mediated pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, other immune-mediated adverse reactions, infection, and infusion-related reactions. Please refer to the full Prescribing Information for important dosage modification and management information specific to adverse reactions.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and evaluate with radiographic imaging when suspected. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 pneumonitis; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, pneumonitis occurred in 5% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.8%), Grade 4 (<0.1%), and Grade 5 (0.3%) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 1.5% of the 1889 patients. The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) was higher in patients in the PACIFIC study who completed treatment with definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI (34%) compared to patients in other clinical studies (2.3%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI. In the PACIFIC study, the incidence of Grade 3 pneumonitis was 3.4% and of Grade 5 pneumonitis was 1.1% in the IMFINZI arm. In the PACIFIC study, pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 6% of patients.

The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis were similar whether IMFINZI was given as a single agent in patients with various cancers or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatitis during and after discontinuation of IMFINZI, including clinical chemistry monitoring. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or higher elevations of ALT, AST, and/or total bilirubin. Withhold IMFINZI for ALT or AST greater than 3 but less than or equal to 8 times the ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1.5 but less than or equal to 5 times the ULN; permanently discontinue IMFINZI for ALT or AST greater than 8 times the ULN or total bilirubin greater than 5 times the ULN or concurrent ALT or AST greater than 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 times the ULN with no other cause.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, hepatitis occurred in 12% of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%), Grade 4 (0.4%), and Grade 5 (0.2%) hepatitis. Hepatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.7% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis or diarrhea. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 colitis or diarrhea; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 colitis or diarrhea.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, colitis or diarrhea occurred in 18% of patients, including Grade 3 (1.0%) and Grade 4 (0.1%) immune-mediated colitis. Diarrhea or colitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.4% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies.

Thyroid disorders—Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment. Initiate hormone replacement therapy or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grades 2–4 hyperthyroidism, until clinically stable. Continue IMFINZI for hypothyroidism.
In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, hypothyroidism occurred in 11% of patients, while hyperthyroidism occurred in 7% of patients. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.9% of patients, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism was preceded by thyroiditis or hyperthyroidism in 25% of patients.
Adrenal insufficiency—Administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated and withhold IMFINZI until clinically stable for Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency. In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.7% of patients, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adrenal insufficiency.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus—Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grades 2–4 type 1 diabetes mellitus, until clinically stable. In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in <0.1% of patients.
Hypophysitis—Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated and withhold IMFINZI until clinically stable for Grade 2 or higher hypophysitis. Hypopituitarism leading to adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus occurred in <0.1% of 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated nephritis, defined as evidence of renal dysfunction requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have occurred. Monitor patients for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI. Administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for creatinine greater than 1.5 to 3 times the ULN; permanently discontinue IMFINZI and administer corticosteroids in patients with creatinine greater than 3 times the ULN.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, nephritis (reported as any of the following: increased creatinine or urea, acute kidney injury, renal failure, decreased glomerular filtration rate, tubulointerstitial nephritis, decreased creatinine clearance, glomerulonephritis, and nephritis) occurred in 6.3% of the patients including Grade 3 (1.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), and Grade 5 (0.1%) nephritis. IMFINZI was discontinued in 0.3% of the 1889 patients.

Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Reactions

IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated rash. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has occurred with other products in this class. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 rash or dermatitis lasting for more than 1 week or for Grade 3 or 4 rash or dermatitis. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 2 rash or dermatitis lasting longer than 1 week or Grade 3 rash or dermatitis; permanently discontinue IMFINZI in patients with Grade 4 rash or dermatitis.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, 26% of patients developed rash or dermatitis and 0.4% of the patients developed vitiligo. Rash or dermatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.1% of the 1889 patients.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

IMFINZI can cause severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. While immune-mediated reactions usually manifest during treatment with IMFINZI, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of IMFINZI. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes and initiate corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions, unless clinical judgment indicates discontinuation; permanently discontinue IMFINZI for Grade 4 adverse reactions.

The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in 1889 patients who received IMFINZI: aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, myositis, and ocular inflammatory toxicity, including uveitis and keratitis. In patients who received IMFINZI in clinical studies outside of the pooled dataset, myasthenia gravis occurred at an incidence of less than 0.1%. Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if myasthenia gravis does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory and/or autonomic insufficiency. Additional clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions have been seen with other products in this class (see Warnings and Precautions Section 5.7 of IMFINZI full Prescribing Information).

Infection

IMFINZI can cause serious infections, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as clinically indicated. Withhold IMFINZI for Grade 3 or 4 infection, until clinically stable.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, infections occurred in 43% of patients, including Grade 3 (8%), Grade 4 (1.9%), and Grade 5 (1.0%). The overall incidence of infections in IMFINZI-treated patients in the PACIFIC study (56%) was higher compared to patients in other clinical studies (38%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI. In patients with UC in Study 1108 (n=182), the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was urinary tract infections, which occurred in 4% of patients. In patients with Stage III NSCLC in the PACIFIC study, the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia, which occurred in 5% of patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grades 1–2 infusion-related reactions; permanently discontinue for Grades 3–4 infusion-related reactions.

In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.3%).

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no data on the use of IMFINZI in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI.

Lactation

There is no information regarding the presence of IMFINZI in human milk; however, because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from IMFINZI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

NOTES TO EDITORS

About Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.8 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with about 85% classified as NSCLC and 15% classified as SCLC.9

Stage III NSCLC (locally advanced) is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.10 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasized), as the majority of Stage III patients are treated with curative intent.10,11 In 2015, Stage III NSCLC was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight key countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.2

SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to chemotherapy.12,13 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.14 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.14

About PACIFIC

The PACIFIC trial was a Phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of IMFINZI (durvalumab) as treatment in “all-comer’” patients (regardless of PD-L1 status) with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed following concurrent platinum-based CRT.

The trial was conducted at 235 centers across 26 countries involving 713 patients. The primary endpoints of the trial were PFS and OS, and secondary endpoints included landmark PFS and OS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

About CASPIAN

CASPIAN is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or IMFINZI and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with up to four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial is being conducted in more than 200 centers across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is OS in each of the experimental arms.

About IMFINZI® (durvalumab)

IMFINZI is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumor’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

IMFINZI is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. IMFINZI is approved for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy in the US and Singapore. IMFINZI is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.

As part of a broad development program, IMFINZI is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumors.

About AstraZeneca Support Programs

AstraZeneca strives to ensure that appropriate patients and their oncologists have access to IMFINZI and relevant support resources. These include educational resources, an Oncology Nurse Educator program and affordability and reimbursement programs, such as Access 360™.

Additionally, AstraZeneca has launched Lighthouse, a program that provides support to patients during any immune-mediated adverse events they may encounter during treatment, through medically trained Lighthouse Advocates. The program aims to make patients’ treatment experience as comfortable as possible. Find out more about Lighthouse at LighthouseProgram.com or call 1-855-LHOUSE1(1-855-546-8731).

About AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action.

An extensive Immuno-Oncology development program focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represent up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.15 IMFINZI, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (POSEIDON and PEARL Phase III trials) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially curative settings (MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC Phase III trials) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy.

About AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumors. Our IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumor immune suppression. We are invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumor types.

We are pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial program that includes IMFINZI as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumor types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumors.

About AstraZeneca in Oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future.

September 19, 2020 01:04 PM Eastern Daylight Time
WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Results from a prespecified exploratory analysis of the positive ADAURA Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in central nervous system (CNS) disease-free survival (DFS) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after complete tumor resection.

While up to 30% of all patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is still common in early-stage disease.1-3 CNS recurrence, when cancer spreads to the brain, is a frequent complication of EGFRm NSCLC and these patients have an especially poor prognosis.4,5

Results were presented on September 19, 2020 during the Presidential Symposium of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 (abstract #LBA1) and simultaneously published with the primary results in The New England Journal of Medicine.

This analysis showed that fewer patients treated with TAGRISSO in the adjuvant setting had recurrence events or deaths compared to placebo (11% versus 46%). Among patients whose cancer recurred, 38% of those treated with TAGRISSO had a metastatic recurrence compared to 61% of patients on placebo. TAGRISSO showed an 82% reduction in the risk of CNS recurrence or death (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.33; p<0.0001). Median CNS DFS was not yet reached in either arm.

In a post-hoc analysis, the estimated probability of observing disease recurrence in the brain at 18 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO was less than 1% versus 9% for placebo among patients who had not experienced another type of recurrence. On the primary endpoint of DFS in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease, TAGRISSO in the adjuvant setting reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.12-0.23; p<0.0001).

Masahiro Tsuboi, MD, PhD, director of the Department of Thoracic Surgery and Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East in Japan, and a principal investigator in the ADAURA Phase III trial, said: “It’s time to change the notion that treatment for early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer ends after surgery, since recurrence rates are still very high even after adjuvant chemotherapy. These new data showing low rates of recurrence, particularly in the brain, combined with the remarkable disease-free survival benefit, clearly demonstrate that TAGRISSO provides patients with more time living cancer-free.”

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Once lung cancer has spread to the brain, outcomes are typically devastating for patients. We are now seeing TAGRISSO expanding on its proven efficacy in treating progression in the brain in the metastatic setting as a result of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The striking new data show that TAGRISSO prevents the development of brain metastases in patients with early disease and reinforce that this medicine is truly transformative for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. TAGRISSO should become the standard of care in the adjuvant setting, just as it is for patients with metastatic disease around the world.”

The safety and tolerability of TAGRISSO in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic EGFRm NSCLC setting. Adverse events at Grade 3 or higher from all causes occurred in 10% of patients in the TAGRISSO arm versus 3% in the placebo arm as assessed by investigators.

TAGRISSO is not currently approved in the adjuvant setting in any country. TAGRISSO received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in July 2020 for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC after complete tumor resection with curative intent. TAGRISSO is approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

TAGRISSO IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

There are no contraindications for TAGRISSO
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.4% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (eg, dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD is confirmed
Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurred in TAGRISSO-treated patients. Of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients in clinical trials, 0.9% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 3.6% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia
Cardiomyopathy occurred in 2.6% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and to <50% LVEF occurred in 3.9% of 908 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. Conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, in patients with cardiac risk factors. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO
Keratitis was reported in 0.7% of 1142 patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist
Postmarketing cases consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme major (EMM) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if SJS or EMM is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed
Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception for 4 months after the final dose
Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail toxicity, stomatitis, fatigue and decreased appetite

About Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.6 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.7 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3

For those with resectable tumors, the majority of patients eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.8 Early-stage lung cancer diagnoses are often only made when the cancer is found on imaging for an unrelated condition.9,10

Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.11-13 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells.14

About ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomized, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. Patients were treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg once-daily oral tablets or placebo for three years or until disease recurrence.

The trial enrolled in more than 200 centers across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess OS.

About TAGRISSO

TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against central nervous system metastases. TAGRISSO 40 mg and 80 mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC.

ALUNBRIG IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. ILD/pneumonitis occurred within 8 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG in 2.9% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.2% of patients. In Trial ALTA, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90→180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG (median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis.

Hypertension: In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), hypertension was reported in 32% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG; Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 13% of patients. In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia.

Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose.

Hyperglycemia: In the ALUNBRIG arm of trial ALTA 1L (180 mg once daily), 56% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 7.5% of patients. In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In ALTA 1L, serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. The most common serious adverse reactions other than disease progression were pneumonia (4.4%), ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%), pyrexia (2.9%), dyspnea (2.2%), pulmonary embolism (2.2%), and asthenia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions other than disease progression occurred in 2.9% of patients and included pneumonia (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.7%).

In ALTA, serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group).

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as it may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. If coadministration of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG.

CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, increase the dose of ALUNBRIG.

CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with sensitive CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy of sensitive CYP3A substrates.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Pregnancy: ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.

Lactation: There are no data regarding the secretion of brigatinib in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALUNBRIG.

About Inflazome

Inflazome is a biotech company leading the development of orally available drugs to address clinical unmet needs in inflammatory diseases by targeting inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are understood to drive many chronic inflammatory conditions, from Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s to asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and NASH. Inflazome has a portfolio of orally available small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors, with lead molecules having successfully completed Phase I clinical trials, as well as several high potential earlier-stage programmes.

Inflazome has raised €55m in Venture Capital financing from leading investors Forbion, Longitude Capital, Fountain Healthcare Partners and Novartis Venture Fund.

Inflazome is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.

About the NLRP3 Inflammasome

Activated NLRP3 acts as a ‘danger sensor’ in the body to release the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and induce uncontrolled, lytic cell death (pyroptosis). These processes lead to chronic inflammation, and as such, NLRP3 has been implicated in a large number of diseases.

48835,AstraZeneca and MSD's Lynparza (Olaparib) Receives the CHMP's Positive Opinion as 1L Maintenance Treatment for HRD-Positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza recommended for approval in EU by CHMP as 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer,"The CHMP has recommended the approval of Lynparza + bevacizumab for the 1L maintenance treatment of patients with HRD+ advanced ovarian cancer. The positive opinion is based on a biomarker subgroup analysis of P-III PAOLA-1 study
 The P-III PAOLA-1 study involves assessing of Lynparza + bevacizumab vs bevacizumab as monothx. for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous/ endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1L treatment with Pt. based CT and bevacizumab
 The study resulted in 67% reduction the risk of disease progression or death, improved PFS (37.2 vs 17.7 mos.). Further results of PAOLA-1 trial demonstrated improvement in the time to second disease progression, PFS2 (50.3 vs 35.3 mos.), presented at ESMO 2020","Patients treated with Lynparza and bevacizumab lived without disease progression for a median of 37.2 months vs. 17.7 months for bevacizumab alone
One in two women with advanced ovarian cancer has an HRD-positive tumour

AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza (olaparib) has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for the 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab of patients with homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on a biomarker subgroup analysis of the PAOLA-1 Phase III trial, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial showed that Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (based on a hazard ratio of 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.45). The addition of Lynparza improved progression-free survival (PFS) to a median of 37.2 months versus 17.7 months with bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer.

For patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of 1st-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent to achieve long-term remission.1-3

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in Europe and the five-year survival rate is approximately 45%, due in part because women are often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV).4,5

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Half of all newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer have HRD-positive tumours. Lynparza together with bevacizumab has demonstrated a median progression-free survival benefit of more than three years, offering new hope for women in this setting. This recommendation is a vital step toward addressing a significant unmet need and could bring a new treatment option that delays relapse in this devastating disease.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “HRD is an important biomarker of advanced ovarian cancer that can inform how physicians in the EU treat this aggressive type of cancer. This recommendation and the results from the PAOLA-1 trial underscore the importance of HRD testing at diagnosis to determine the best course of treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer.”

The CHMP recommendation is for Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated with HRD positive status defined by either a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation and/or genomic instability.

Further results from the PAOLA-1 trial recently presented during the 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology virtual congress showed that Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab maintenance treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the time to second disease progression (PFS2) versus bevacizumab alone in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer, a key secondary endpoint. The results showed Lynparza with bevacizumab provided benefit beyond first disease progression, improving PFS2 to a median of 50.3 months versus 35.3 months with bevacizumab alone.

Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is approved in the US and several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer and is currently under regulatory review in other countries around the world.

Ovarian cancer

In 2018, there were nearly 68,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in Europe and around 45,000 deaths.4 Approximately 50% of ovarian cancers are HRD-positive including BRCA1/2 mutation.6,7 Approximately 22% of ovarian cancers have a BRCA1/2 mutation.6-8

Homologous recombination deficiency

HRD, which defines a subgroup of ovarian cancer, encompasses a wide range of genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations and beyond. As with BRCA gene mutations, HRD interferes with normal cell DNA repair mechanisms and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors including Lynparza.9

PAOLA-1

PAOLA-1 is a double-blind Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of Lynparza added to standard-of-care bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone, as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed advanced FIGO Stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer patients who had a complete or partial response to 1st-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. AstraZeneca and MSD announced in August 2019 that the trial met its primary endpoint of PFS in the overall trial population.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer (BRCAm and/or genomic instability). Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for HRR gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCAm and other HRR gene mutations). Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

LAVAL, QC and SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif., Sept. 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health”) and Bausch + Lomb, its leading global eye health business, and Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC (Allegro), a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies that regulate integrin functions for the treatment of ocular diseases, announced today that Bausch Health (through its affiliate) has entered into an agreement to acquire an option to purchase all ophthalmology assets of Allegro (the “Option”), including global rights for risuteganib (Luminate®)1, Allegro’s lead investigational compound in retina, which is believed to simultaneously act on the angiogenic, inflammatory and mitochondrial metabolic pathways implicated in diseases such as intermediate dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

(PRNewsfoto/Bausch Health Companies Inc.)
It is estimated that as many as 16 million people in the United States have AMD2, and globally, the prevalence of AMD is expected to reach 196 million people worldwide this year and to increase to 288 million by 2040.3 Approximately 90 percent of people diagnosed with AMD have dry AMD, for which there are currently no treatments.4

“As part of the ongoing transformation of Bausch Health, we continue to seek strategic opportunities to build-up our pipeline in core businesses, including Bausch + Lomb, our global eye health business. The addition of the ophthalmic assets of Allegro would significantly enhance our comprehensive portfolio of products for AMD,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO of Bausch Health. “If approved, risuteganib may be the first treatment indicated to help reverse vision loss due to dry AMD and would address a significant unmet medical need affecting millions of people globally.”

“Allegro is excited to partner with Bausch Health, an established global player in ophthalmology that values the potential of risuteganib and our integrin-regulating platform as much as we do,” said Vicken Karageozian, M.D., president and CEO, Allegro. “As we prepare for our Phase 3 clinical program, we look forward to working closely with Bausch Health on the united goal of one day being able to offer a treatment option to the millions of people who are currently losing their vision to dry AMD.”

Risuteganib is an investigational integrin-regulating therapy that is believed to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction involved in intermediate dry AMD. By targeting multiple pathways, risuteganib may help reduce the cellular burden of oxidative stress and restore retinal homeostasis.5 Two concurrent Phase 3 studies evaluating the use of intravitreal risuteganib to treat intermediate dry AMD are expected to begin within the next 12 months.

Other ophthalmology assets of Allegro include ALG-1007, a topical integrin regulator under investigation for the treatment of dry eye disease. It is currently in Phase 2 development outside the United States.

The Option payment totaling $50 million would be made in two tranches, with the first payment of $10 million upon signing. Allegro intends to raise additional funding, following which, Bausch Health will make a second payment of $40 million, which is expected to be made in 2021. If Bausch Health then elects to exercise the Option, additional payments will be payable.

Final overall survival data from the Phase III IMpassion130 study were consistent with prior interim analyses in patients with metastatic TNBC, whose tumours expressed PD-L1 and who received Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel
Results from the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of people with metastatic TNBC and whose tumours expressed PD-L1, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival
Basel, 19 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that it presented the latest results from three Phase III studies from the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) clinical development programme in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020.

“While we have made great progress in the treatment of many forms of breast cancer, TNBC remains an aggressive and difficult-to-treat disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are proud of our work to address challenges and advance scientific understanding of cancer immunotherapy in the context of distinct chemotherapy regimens and in various TNBC treatment settings. Although the IMpassion131 study did not reach its endpoint, we are pleased to bring new treatment options for some TNBC patients, and remain committed to improving the lives of all women with early and advanced stages of this disease.”

Results from the Phase III IMpassion031 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane®, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy (including nab-paclitaxel), demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) for the treatment of people with early TNBC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. pCR was observed in 57.6% (95% CI: 49.7–65.2) of patients treated with Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy, an increase of 16.5% from 41.1% (95% CI: 33.6–48.9) in patients treated with placebo plus chemotherapy (one-sided p=0.0044, significance boundary = 0.0184) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The safety profile was consistent with the established profile of the individual drugs and no new safety concerns were identified.

The IMpassion031 study is the second positive Phase III study from Roche demonstrating the benefit of Tecentriq in TNBC, and the first Tecentriq study to demonstrate benefit in early TNBC. Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is currently approved in more than 70 countries worldwide, including the US and across Europe, for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC in people whose tumours express PD-L1 (IC≥1%).

The final overall survival (OS) analysis of the Phase III IMpassion130 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel, as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC, was consistent with the first and second interim analyses. There was no significant difference in OS between the treatment groups in the ITT population. Clinically meaningful improvements in OS were seen with Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel in PD-L1-positive patients. The magnitude of OS improvements with Tecentriq in PD-L1-positive patients remained clinically meaningful, with an increase of 7.5 months in median OS with Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67; 95% CI: 0.53–0.86). However, this result could not be formally tested due to the prespecified statistical testing hierarchy. The cumulative safety of the Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel combination remains consistent with the previously reported safety data for this study and the known risks of individual study drugs. No new safety concerns were identified with longer follow-up.

Finally, results from the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, compared with placebo plus paclitaxel, as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC, did not show significant improvement for progression-free survival in the PD-L1-positive population (HR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.60–1.12). The OS data showed a negative trend; however, the study was not powered for the secondary endpoint of OS, and OS data were immature at time of analysis (initial HR=1.55 [95% CI: 0.86-2.80] in the PD-L1 positive population, based on 21% of patients with an event; updated HR=1.12 [95% CI: 0.76-1.65]), updated analysis based on 41% of patients with an event). The safety profile of Tecentriq plus paclitaxel was consistent with the established safety profile of the individual study drugs and no new safety concerns were identified.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion031 study
The IMpassion031 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane®, albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in comparison to placebo plus chemotherapy, in people with previously untreated, early TNBC. The study enrolled 333 people who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) setting. Treatment with Tecentriq continued adjuvantly (after surgery) for those in the Tecentriq arm of the study. The primary endpoint is pCR using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-positive population. Secondary endpoints include OS, event-free survival, disease-free survival and quality of life measures.

About the IMpassion130 study
The IMpassion130 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel in people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The study enrolled 902 people who were randomised equally (1:1). The co-primary endpoints are PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) and OS in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-positive population. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate and duration of response.

About the IMpassion131 study
The IMpassion131 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, in people with previously untreated, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study enrolled 651 people who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the PD-L1-positive population followed by ITT populations. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR and duration of response in the PD-L1-positive and ITT populations.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic HCC.

48861,Lilly's Olumiant (baricitinib) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,CHMP Recommends Approval of Lilly’s Baricitinib for the Treatment of Adults with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,"The positive opinion is based on P-III BREEZE-AD program including BREEZE-AD1 & BREEZE-AD2 studies assessing baricitinib as monothx. in mod. to sev. AD patients
 The CHMP’s recommendation also involves a BREEZE-AD4 study assessing baricitinib + topical corticosteroids in patients with mod. to sev. AD who have failed or who are intolerant to or have contraindications to cyclosporine and BREEZE-AD7 study assessing baricitinib + topical corticosteroids in patients with mod. to sev. AD
 The positive opinion marks the first step toward EU approval for baricitinib for patients with AD. If approved, the therapy would become the first JAK inhibitor for AD with expected EC’s decision in the next 2mos.","Positive Opinion is the First Regulatory Action for Baricitinib as an Atopic Dermatitis Medicine
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) announced today that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion for baricitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy.

This opinion marks the first step toward European regulatory approval for baricitinib (marketed as OLUMIANT®) for patients with AD. If approved, baricitinib would become the first JAK inhibitor indicated to help treat patients with AD. The CHMP opinion is now referred for action to the European Commission, which grants approval in the European Union. A final decision is expected from the European Commission in the next one-two months.

“Due to the limited treatment options currently available for adult patients with AD, we’re excited to further explore baricitinib’s potential benefit for patients,” said Patrik Jonsson, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “At Lilly, we aspire to elevate treatment standards for patients with dermatologic conditions. Today’s CHMP opinion brings us closer to providing a new medicine for adults living with AD in Europe.”

The positive opinion was based on Lilly’s Phase 3 BREEZE-AD clinical development program for baricitinib evaluating the medicine’s potential to treat AD including BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, monotherapy studies investigating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in moderate to severe AD patients; BREEZE-AD4, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe AD who have failed or who are intolerant to, or have contraindications to cyclosporine; and BREEZE-AD7, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe AD.

“Patients living with AD face difficulties on a daily basis, and this CHMP opinion marks an important milestone in providing adult AD patients with a new potential treatment option,” said Prof. Thomas Bieber, M.D., Ph.D., M.D.R.A., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital in Bonn, Germany.

OLUMIANT® is already approved in more than 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Lilly has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases under a license and collaboration agreement with Incyte.

Information on the previously approved EU OLUMIANT indication (Rheumatoid Arthritis) can be found here.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY: Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

About OLUMIANT®

OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderately- to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, and approved outside of the U.S. for patients with moderately- to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.1 There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.2 OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.1 OLUMIANT is approved in more than 70 countries. OLUMIANT is developed by Lilly under license from Incyte Corporation.

About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD), or atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body.3 AD is a heterogeneous disease both biologically and clinically, but may be characterized by chronic symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations.4,5 AD affects approximately one-three percent of adults worldwide.6 

Moderate to severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin.7 Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.8

48870,Novartis' Kisqali (ribociclib) Receives Highest Score on the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale,Novartis Kisqali receives the highest rating of any CDK4/6 inhibitor on the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scal,"Novartis’ Kisqali + endocrine therapy has achieved 5 out of 5 scores on ESMO-MCBS, confirming substantial benefit for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC, based on OS benefit and improved QoL in the P-III MONALEESA-7 study
 Kisqali is also the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to receive a score of 4 out of 5 in combination with fulvestrant for 1L postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC based on the OS benefit and maintained QoL observed in P-III MONALEESA-3. Additionally, Kisqali + fulvestrant receive a score of 4 out of 5 in a 2L setting based on the MONALEEA-3 study
 New data presented at ESMO 2020 add to the substantial body of evidence further differentiating Kisqali as the only CDK 4/6 inhibitor that improves OS in two P- III trials, with consistent results across patient subgroups, and with QoL benefits. Kisqali in patients with endocrine resistance led to a 30% & 41% reduction in the risk of death in the MONALEESA-3 & -7 studies over standard endocrine therapy respectively","Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, to achieve a perfect 5 out of 5 score – confirming substantial benefit for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (aBC), based on significant overall survival (OS) benefit and improved quality of life, in the MONALEESA-7 study1
Kisqali is also the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to receive a score of 4 out of 5 for first-line postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- aBC based on the OS benefit and maintained quality of life observed in MONALEESA-32
New data at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 add to the substantial body of evidence further differentiating Kisqali as the only CDK 4/6 inhibitor that significantly improves OS in two phase III trials, with consistent results across patient subgroups, and with quality of life benefits
Basel, September 21, 2020 — Novartis proudly announces that Kisqali® (ribociclib) has achieved a score of five out of five on the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) for first-line premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer1. This perfect score was achieved as a result of the significant overall survival benefit and the quality of life improvements demonstrated by Kisqali plus endocrine therapy for premenopausal women in the Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial.

Kisqali also received an ESMO-MCBS score of four out of five, the highest score achieved by any CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant for first-line postmenopausal patients, based on the statistically significant overall survival benefit observed in the Phase III MONALEESA-3 study and maintained quality of life2. A score of four out of five was also granted for Kisqali plus fulvestrant in the second-line setting based on the MONALEEA-3 study.



Achieving a five on the ESMO-MCBS is the highest grade in the non-curative setting, and Kisqali received the highest scores across the board in advanced or metastatic breast cancer due to the body of evidence supporting the overall survival and quality of life benefits it provides. The ESMO-MCBS is a validated tool for physicians to assess the value of cancer treatments, and ultimately make informed treatment decisions for their patients.

Additionally, new Kisqali data will be presented during the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 further build on the robust body of evidence. Key presentations include:

An analysis that found Kisqali plus endocrine therapy demonstrated consistent improvement in overall survival in patients with endocrine-resistant HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, which is typically more challenging to treat. Treatment with Kisqali in patients with endocrine resistance led to a 30% and 41% reduction in the risk of death in the MONALEESA-3 and -7 studies over standard endocrine therapy, respectively. Safety was consistent with the overall study populations in both trials4.
An oral presentation of a robust pooled analysis of patient-reported outcomes from MONALEESA-2, -3, and -7 trials in first-line patients, which demonstrated improvement in quality of life for patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer upon receiving Kisqali plus endocrine therapy with consistency in different subgroups analyzed5.
A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), a method used to estimate the comparative effectiveness of treatments after adjusting for differences in the patient populations where head-to-head trials do not exist, indicated that patients taking Kisqali plus fulvestrant as first-line therapy may live significantly longer than those taking palbociclib plus letrozole, based on the MONALEESA-3 and PALOMA-1 trials, respectively6. A trend toward improved progression free survival (PFS) for Kisqali plus fulvestrant versus palbociclib plus letrozole was also observed.
“The totality of these data presented at ESMO confirm the proven overall survival and quality of life benefits with Kisqali, reinforcing it as the standard of care for advanced breast cancer patients,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “We are proud to continue advancing the science across multiple breast cancer patient populations, including exploring the potential of Kisqali in early breast cancer.”

About Kisqali® (ribociclib)
Kisqali is the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the largest body of first-line clinical trial evidence demonstrating consistent and sustained efficacy compared to endocrine therapy alone. Overall survival results from MONALEESA-7 and MONALEESA-3 were presented at ASCO 2019 and ESMO 2019 respectively, demonstrating Kisqali plus endocrine therapy significantly extends life in pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Overall survival follow-up is ongoing for the Phase III MONALEESA-2 trial.

Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide.

Novartis is continuing to reimagine cancer by investigating Kisqali in early breast cancer. The NATALEE study is a Phase III clinical trial of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer being conducted in collaboration with Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO).

Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.

About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer
Novartis tackles breast cancer with superior science, collaboration and a passion for transforming patient care. We’ve taken a bold approach to our research by including patient populations often neglected in clinical trials, identifying new pathways or mutations that may play a role in disease progression and developing therapies that not only maintain, but also improve, quality of life for patients. Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.

Important Safety Information from the Kisqali EU SmPC
Kisqali® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine – based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine – based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children or adolescents. Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Kisqali is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali. The most common side effects (incidence >=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence >5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

Genetic modifiers are genes that counteract the effect of a disease-causing gene. They may explain why some people with genetic mutations linked to severe disease end up having only mild or no symptoms. Also known as disease suppressors, genetic modifiers therefore positively influence the severity of disease and act as a ‘natural form of protection’. Their discovery is leading to a completely new class of drug targets.

Under the terms of the agreement, Scenic will utilize its Cell-Seq platform and its data warehouse of genetic modifiers to identify drug targets in multiple therapeutic areas. The collaboration enables Genentech to select multiple targets for further development with an option to extend the collaboration. Scenic will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and is eligible to receive additional target selection fees for drug targets taken forward by Genentech. In addition, Scenic is eligible for success-based payments for each target based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones, as well as royalties on sales of certain products resulting from the collaboration. Total deal value could exceed US $375M.

Scenic has built an extensive proprietary data warehouse of genetic modifiers and its Cell-Seq platform enables the development of potential disease modifying therapeutics for devastating diseases with an in-house focus on inherited rare diseases and immuno-oncology/inflammation.

The Company was founded in 2017 as a spin-out of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and Oxford University and recently appointed Oscar Izeboud, PhD as its Chief Executive Officer.

Dr Sebastian Nijman, Co-founder and CSO of Scenic Biotech said: “Genentech is the pioneer in innovative biotech and has world leading research and development capabilities. Scenic is a science-driven company and having Genentech as our first major industry partner is a great validation of our technology and by working together it will extend the utility of our platform beyond our current therapeutic areas of interest. The collaboration also brings significant strategic value for Scenic as it enables us to realise the potential of our genetic modifier expertise alongside independently advancing our own programs towards clinical development.”

About Scenic Biotech
Scenic Biotech is focused on identifying genetic modifiers, a completely new class of disease targets, for drug intervention. Also known as disease suppressors, genetic modifiers are genes that act to suppress or completely block the effect of a disease-causing mutated gene.

As a pioneer in the field, Scenic Biotech is building the largest proprietary data warehouse of genetic modifiers and has already identified a number of novel genetic modifiers for over a dozen inherited diseases. This approach is enabling the development of disease modifying therapeutics for devastating diseases including inherited rare diseases and cancer.

48885,Alexion's Ultomiris (ravulizumab) Receives the CHMP's Positive Opinion for its New Advanced Formulation,Alexion Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for New Advanced Formulation of ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab) with Significantly Reduced Infusion Time,"The CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization in the EU for a new 100 mg/mL (IV) advanced formulation of Ultomiris (ravulizumab). The positive opinion is based on CMC submission and a supplementary clinical data set showing that the safety, PK, and immunogenicity following administration of Ultomiris (10mg/mL & 100mg/mL) were comparable
 Results: no effect in efficacy measure of mean LDH; reduction in infusion time by more than half (1.3 to 3.3hrs.) & (0.4 to 1.3hrs.) depending on the body weight, respectively. If approved, the new 100 mg/mL formulation will reduce infusion time by ~60%, lessening the burden on patients and health systems
 The company plans to submit regulatory filings in the US and EU in the Q3’21 for an Ultomiris (SC) and device combination for PNH and aHUS that can be self-administered at home, pending completion of the ongoing P-III study and collection of 12mos. safety data. Additionally, Alexion expands the clinical program of Ultomiris across hematology, nephrology, neurology, and for severe COVID-19, with 7 P-III programs that are ongoing or have planned clinical trial initiations in 2020","– If approved, the new 100 mg/mL formulation will reduce infusion time by approximately 60%, lessening the burden on patients and health systems –

– ULTOMIRIS is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) –

– European Commission decision anticipated in November 2020 –

BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sep. 21, 2020– Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization in the European Union for a new 100 mg/mL intravenous (IV) advanced formulation of ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab). ULTOMIRIS is the first and only long-acting C5 inhibitor administered every eight weeks for the treatment of two ultra-rare diseases—paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL would constitute an advancement in the treatment experience for patients with aHUS and PNH by reducing average annual infusion times by approximately 60 percent compared to ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL while delivering comparable safety and efficacy. With ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL, most patients will spend six hours or less a year receiving treatment.

“ULTOMIRIS is anticipated to be the new standard of care for people with PNH and aHUS and the advanced formulation would reduce the time they spend receiving their infusion. Lessening the overall burden on healthcare systems, especially at a time when many are already under strain due to the pandemic, is an important advance,” said Professor Röth, Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.

PNH is a blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated destruction of the red blood cells that can cause a wide range of debilitating symptoms and complications, including thrombosis, which can occur throughout the body, and result in organ damage and premature death. Atypical HUS can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. Affecting both adults and children, aHUS patients can present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of both aHUS and PNH can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis—in addition to appropriate treatment—is critical to improving patient outcomes.

“The advanced formulation of ULTOMIRIS marks continued progress in Alexion’s ongoing efforts to innovate for patients, and we expect it will represent yet another step in refining the treatment schedule for patients,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “Importantly, it would mean that most patients would spend only six hours or less a year receiving treatment, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their lives.”

The CHMP positive opinion is based on a comprehensive chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) submission and a supplementary clinical data set showing that the safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity following administration of ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL and ULTOMIRIS 100mg/mL were comparable. Similarly, the data set showed no notable effect in the efficacy measure of mean lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels across the two formulations. The new proposed formulation requires an infusion time of 0.4 to 1.3 hours (25 to 75 minutes) depending on body weight, reducing the infusion time by more than half compared with the currently available 10mg/mL IV formulation, which ranges from 1.3 to 3.3 hours (77 to 194 minutes) depending on body weight.

The European Commission typically reaches a decision on approval in approximately two months of the CHMP recommendation.

Alexion continues to innovate with ULTOMIRIS, with the goal of improving the patient experience. We plan to submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU in the third quarter of 2021 for an ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous formulation and device combination for PNH and aHUS that can be self-administered at home, pending completion of the ongoing Phase 3 study and collection of 12-month safety data. In addition, the collective ULTOMIRIS clinical development programs present an opportunity to expand the treated patient populations across hematology, nephrology, neurology and for the treatment of severe COVID-19, with seven Phase 3 programs that are ongoing or have planned clinical trial initiations in 2020.

About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

PNH is a serious ultra-rare blood disorder with devastating consequences. It is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, which is also referred to as hemolysis. PNH occurs when the complement system—a part of the body’s immune system—over-responds, leading the body to attack its own red blood cells. PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis from one to more than five years. Patients with PNH may experience a range of symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, dark-colored urine and anemia. The most devastating consequence of chronic hemolysis is the formation of blood clots, which can occur in blood vessels throughout the body, damage vital organs, and potentially lead to premature death. PNH can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.

About Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)

aHUS is an ultra-rare disease that can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. aHUS occurs when the complement system—a part of the body’s immune system—over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. aHUS can cause sudden organ failure or a slow loss of function over time—potentially resulting in the need for a transplant, and in some cases, death. aHUS affects both adults and children, and many patients present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of aHUS can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis—in addition to treatment—is critical to improving patient outcomes. Available tests can help distinguish aHUS from other hemolytic diseases with similar symptoms.

About ULTOMIRIS®

ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or, for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, every four weeks following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the European Union (EU) for treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity and in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. It is also approved in the United States (US) and Japan as a treatment for adults with PNH. It is also approved in the U.S. for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients, as well as in the EU for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with aHUS.

Short ULTOMIRIS SmPC – June 2020

ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab) Prescribing Information

Please refer to the SmPC for further information before prescribing.

ULTOMIRIS 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

Qualitative and quantitative composition: One vial of 30 mL contains 30 0mg of ravulizumab, produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture by recombinant DNA technology. After dilution, the final concentration of the solution to be infused is 5 mg/mL. Excipient(s) with known effect: Sodium (5 mmol per vial). Clear to translucent, slight whitish colour, pH 7.0 solution.

Therapeutic indication: Treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity and in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. Treatment of patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab.

Posology and method of administration. Posology: The recommended dosing regimen consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, administered by intravenous infusion. The doses to be administered are based on the patient’s body weight. For adult patients (≥ 18 years of age), maintenance doses should be administered at a once every 8 week interval, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary by ± 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for the first maintenance dose of ravulizumab) but the subsequent dose should be administered according to the original schedule. For patients switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab, the loading dose of ravulizumab should be administered 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion, and then maintenance doses are administered once every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Ravulizumab has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40 kg. There is no experience of concomitant PE/PI (plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion) use with ravulizumab. Administration of PE/PI may reduce ravulizumab serum levels. In aHUS, ravulizumab treatment to resolve TMA manifestations should be for a minimum duration of 6 months, beyond which length of treatment needs to be considered for each patient individually. Patients who are at higher risk for TMA recurrence, as determined by the treating healthcare provider (or clinically indicated), may require chronic therapy. Special Populations: Paediatric patients with aHUS with body weight ≥ 40 kg are treated in accordance with the adult dosing recommendations. The weight-based doses and dosing intervals for paediatric patients ≥ 10 kg to 20 kg is once every 4 week interval, for paediatric patients ≥ 20 kg to 40 kg once every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. Data to support safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for patients with body weight below 10 kg are limited. No recommendation on a posology can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight (please refer to the SmPC for currently available data). The safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration: For intravenous infusion only. ULTOMIRIS must be diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. This medicinal product must be administered through a 0.2 μm filter and should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. ULTOMIRIS must be diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a minimal period of 1.7 to 2.4 hours depending of body weight (please refer to the SmPC).

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection at treatment initiation; in patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Special warnings and precautions for use. Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Serious meningococcal infection: Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection/sepsis (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur. To reduce this risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least two weeks prior to initiating ravulizumab unless the risk of delaying ravulizumab therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate ravulizumab treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine, must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serogroups A, C, Y, W135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national guidelines for vaccination use. If the patient is being switched from eculizumab treatment, physicians should verify that meningococcal vaccination is current according to national guidelines for vaccination use. Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with ravulizumab. Cases of serious or fatal meningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with other terminal complement inhibitors. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection and sepsis, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics. Patients should be informed of these signs and symptoms and steps should be taken to seek medical care immediately. Physicians should provide patients with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card. Immunization: Prior to initiating ravulizumab therapy, it is recommended that PNH and aHUS patients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, including PNH and aHUS, may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying disease, such as haemolysis. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination. Patients below the age of 18 years old must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. Other systemic infections: Ravulizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. Ravulizumab blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria species and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Patients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of potential serious infections and their signs and symptoms. Physicians should advise patients about gonorrhea prevention. Infusion reactions: Administration of ravulizumab may result in infusion reactions. In clinical trials, with PNH and aHUS [(4 out of 296 in patients with PNH) and (4 of 89 patients with aHUS)] patients experienced infusion reactions which were mild in severity and transient [e.g., lower back pain, drop in blood pressure, elevation in blood pressure, limb discomfort, drug hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), and dysgeusia(bad taste)]. In case of infusion reaction, infusion of ravulizumab should be interrupted and appropriate supportive measures should be instituted if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur.

Treatment discontinuation for PNH: If patients with PNH discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis, identified by elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or haemoglobin, or re-appearance of symptoms such as fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Any patient who discontinues ravulizumab should be monitored for at least 16 weeks to detect haemolysis and other reactions. If signs and symptoms of haemolysis occur after discontinuation, including elevated LDH, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab. Treatment discontinuation for aHUS: There are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective observational study, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 13.5-fold higher rate of TMA recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced renal function compared to patients who continued treatment. If patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent severe TMA complications. TMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: (i) At least two of the following laboratory results observed concurrently: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during ravulizumab treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ravulizumab treatment (results should be confirmed by a second measurement), or (ii) any one of the following symptoms of TMA: a change in mental status or seizures or other extra-renal TMA manifestations including cardiovascular abnormalities, pericarditis,

gastrointestinal symptoms/diarrhoea; or thrombosis. If TMA complications occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, consider reinitiation of ravulizumab treatment beginning with the loading dose and maintenance dose. This medicinal product when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection contains 2.65 g sodium per 720 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 133 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: No interaction studies have been performed. Chronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and thereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation. Women of childbearing potential: Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception methods during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment. Pregnancy: There are no clinical data from the use of ravulizumab in pregnant women. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with ravulizumab. Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice using the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1, which assessed effect of C5 blockade on the reproductive system. No specific test-article related reproductive toxicities were identified in these studies. Human IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier, and thus ravulizumab may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in the foetal circulation. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity. In pregnant women the use of ravulizumab may be considered following an assessment of the risks and benefits. Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether ravulizumab is excreted into human milk. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1 identified no adverse effect to pups resulting from consuming milk from treated dams. A risk to infants cannot be excluded. Since many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ravulizumab and up to 8 months after treatment. Fertility: No specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule (BB5.1) identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males.

Undesirable effects. Summary of the safety profile: The most common adverse drug reactions (very common frequency) are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis and headache. The most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical trials are meningococcal infection and meningococcal sepsis. Tabulated list of adverse reactions: Very common adverse reactions observed from PNH and aHUS clinical trials (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection, Nasopharyngitis, Headache, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Pyrexia, Fatigue. Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10): Dizziness, Abdominal pain, Vomiting, Dyspepsia, Rash, Pruritus, Arthralgia, Back pain, Myalgia, Muscle spasms, Influenza like illness, Asthenia. Uncommon adverse reactions (≥1/1,000 to <1/100): Meningococcal infection, Chills. In paediatric patients with evidence of aHUS (aged 10 months to less than 18 years) included in the clinical study, the safety profile of ravulizumab appeared similar to that observed in adult patients with evidence of aHUS. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age appear similar. The safety data for patient below 2 years of age is limited to four patients. The most common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was pyrexia. The safety of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

Transaction Details

Under the terms of the agreement, at closing, GRAIL stockholders (including Illumina) will receive total consideration of $8 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion in cash and $4.5 billion in shares of Illumina common stock, subject to a collar. Illumina currently holds 14.5% of GRAIL’s shares outstanding, and approximately 12% on a fully diluted basis.

The collar on the stock consideration will ensure that GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina receive a number of Illumina shares equal to approximately $4 billion in value if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is between $295 and $399. GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina will receive approximately 9.9 million Illumina shares if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is above $399 and approximately 13.4 million Illumina shares if the 20-trading-day volume weighted average price of Illumina stock as of 10 trading days prior to closing is below $295. Upon closing of the transaction, current Illumina stockholders are expected to own approximately 93% of the combined company, while GRAIL stockholders are expected to own approximately 7% based on the mid-point of the collar.

The cash consideration to GRAIL stockholders excluding Illumina of approximately $3.1 billion is expected to be funded using balance sheet cash of both Illumina and GRAIL plus up to $1 billion in capital raised through either a debt or equity issuance. In advance of this anticipated issuance, Illumina has obtained financing commitments for a $1.0 billion bridge facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

In connection with the transaction, GRAIL stockholders will also receive contingent value rights, which will entitle holders to receive future payments representing a pro rata portion of certain GRAIL-related revenues each year for a 12-year period. This will reflect a 2.5% payment right to the first $1 billion of revenue each year for 12 years. Revenue above $1 billion each year would be subject to a 9% contingent payment right during this same period. Illumina will offer GRAIL stockholders the option to receive additional cash and/or stock consideration, in an amount to be determined prior to closing, in lieu of the contingent value rights.

We expect the transaction will be accretive to Illumina revenue starting in 2021, and to meaningfully accelerate revenue growth over time.

Structure and Approvals

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Illumina expects to close the transaction in the second half of 2021.

Following the completion of the transaction, GRAIL will operate as a standalone division within Illumina with a dedicated leadership team to ensure continuation of GRAIL’s success.

JAKARTA study involves assessing Inrebic (500mg) vs PBO for at least 6 cycles in 289 patients in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L
 The P-II JAKARTA 2 study involves assessing of Inrebic (400mg, qd) in 97 patients prior exposed to ruxolitinib with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L.1
 The 1EPs of the studies is ≥35% reduction in the volume of spleen size at the end of Cycle 6. Inrebic is a JAK inhibitor and is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade","INREBIC® provides new, once-daily oral option for patients affected
by rare bone marrow cancer

MONTREAL, Sept. 21, 2020 /CNW/ – Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) announced today that Health Canada has approved INREBIC® (fedratinib), a new once-daily oral medication used to treat adults with an enlarged spleen and associated symptoms caused by intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.1

INREBIC® is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade to demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in spleen volume for patients in the approved population affected by this serious and rare bone marrow cancer.1 A new treatment provides Canadians living with myelofibrosis, and their caregivers, with more options to find a treatment that works for them.

Myelofibrosis is a serious and rare bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body’s normal production of blood cells.2 Bone marrow is gradually replaced with fibrous scar tissue, which limits the ability of the bone marrow to make blood cells.2 Currently, there are an estimated 1,400 to 2,177 Canadians who are living with myelofibrosis.3

“The approval of INREBIC® represents a milestone for the way healthcare practitioners treat this rare disorder, which can have debilitating symptoms,” said Dr. Vikas Gupta, Director, The Elizabeth and Tony Comper MPN Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto. “Canadians living with myelofibrosis now have a new treatment option that may be better suited to their needs and has shown promise for alleviating the symptom burden associated with myelofibrosis.”

INREBIC® is a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor and is the first new treatment for patients with myelofibrosis in nearly a decade.1,4 JAK proteins send signals that tell the body to make more blood cells, but myelofibrosis makes it difficult for the bone marrow to create normal blood cells, which potentially moves blood cell production to the spleen.1 However, by blocking the activity of JAK proteins, INREBIC® can reduce the size of the spleen and improve symptoms.

“As part of our commitment to Canadians living with cancer, we are excited to provide INREBIC® as a new treatment option for those impacted by myelofibrosis,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “We hope that the option of a once-daily oral treatment will have a positive and meaningful impact on Canadians living with the disease.”

Health Canada’s approval of INREBIC® included findings from the JAKARTA and JAKARTA2 clinical trials. The JAKARTA study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, involved patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. The JAKARTA2 study, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study, involved patients previously exposed to ruxolitinib with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.

About Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of rare blood cancers that are derived from blood-forming stem cells.2 Myelofibrosis can lead to anemia and  thrombocytopenia, weakness, fatigue and enlargement of the spleen and liver, among other symptoms.2 In Canada, approximately 36 to 360 people will be diagnosed with myelofibrosis each year.3 Both men and women are affected, and while the disease can affect people of all ages, the median age at diagnosis is 69 years old.3  

About JAKARTA
JAKARTA was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L. A total of 289 patients were randomized to receive either INREBIC® 500 mg (N=97), 400 mg (N=96), or placebo (N=96) once daily for at least 6 cycles. The median age was 65 years (range 27 to 86 years), 47% of patients were older than 65 years, and 59% were male. Sixty-four percent (64%) of patients had primary MF, 26% had post-polycythemia vera MF, and 10% had post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients had intermediate-2 risk, and 48% had high-risk disease. The median hemoglobin count at baseline was 10.2 g/dL. The median platelet count at baseline was 213.5 x 109/L; 16.3% of patients had a platelet count <100 x 109/L, and 83.7% of patients had a platelet count ≥100 x 109/L. Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 15 cm at baseline and a median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of 2568 mL (range of 316 to 8244 mL) at baseline. (The median normal spleen volume is approximately 215 mL).1

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at the End of Cycle 6 as measured by MRI or CT and confirmed 4 weeks later.1

One of the secondary endpoints was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 diary.1

About JAKARTA2
JAKARTA2 was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study in patients previously exposed to ruxolitinib with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly and platelet count ≥50 x 109/L.1

A total of 97 patients were enrolled and treated with INREBIC® 400 mg once daily. The median age was 67 years (range 38 to 83 years) with 58% of patients older than 65 years and 55% were male. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients had primary MF, 26% had post-polycythemia vera MF, and 19% had post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Sixteen percent (16%) of patients had intermediate-1 with symptoms, 49% had intermediate-2, and 35% had high-risk disease. The median hemoglobin count was 9.8 g/dL at baseline. The median platelet count was 147.0 x 109/L at baseline; 34.0% of patients had a platelet count <100 x 109/L, and 66.0% of patients had a platelet count ≥100 x 109/L. Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 18 cm at baseline and a median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of 2893.5 mL (range of 737 to 7815 mL) at baseline.1

The median duration of prior exposure to ruxolitinib was 10.7 months (range 0.1 to 62.4 months). Seventy-one percent (71%) of patients had received doses of either 30 mg or 40 mg daily of ruxolitinib prior to study entry.1

The primary endpoint was the subject response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who have a ≥35% reduction in volume of spleen size at the end of Cycle 6.1

One of the secondary endpoints was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) from baseline to the End of Cycle 6 as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary.1

About INREBIC®
INREBIC® (fedratinib) is indicated for the treatment of splenomegaly and/or disease related symptoms in adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, including patients who have been previously exposed to ruxolitinib.

(PRNewsfoto/UCB, Inc.)
BRUSSELS, Sept. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the FDA and EMA have accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for bimekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

“After a series of positive Phase 3 data readouts, we are delighted to announce that the U.S. FDA and EMA have accepted our applications to file bimekizumab as a potential new treatment for psoriasis. This milestone brings us one step closer to being able to offer a meaningful new treatment option for people living with this debilitating disease. UCB is committed to providing innovative solutions for people living with serious inflammatory diseases like psoriasis,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

The marketing application submissions for bimekizumab are based on data from a global Phase 3 clinical development program in psoriasis.1,2,3 All Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints, demonstrating that bimekizumab-treated patients achieved superior skin clearance, at week 16, compared to those who received placebo and Humira® (adalimumab) as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0/1).1,2,3

All the Phase 3 studies met their ranked secondary endpoints.1,2,3 Two studies demonstrated superior total skin clearance at week 16, as measured by PASI 100, confirming the superiority of bimekizumab over existing biologic treatments Stelara® (ustekinumab) and adalimumab.2,3 Furthermore, bimekizumab was superior to placebo, ustekinumab and adalimumab in achieving rapid response, defined as PASI 75 at week 4.3 Clinical responses were maintained up to one year in all studies.1,2,3 The safety profile of bimekizumab continues to be consistent with earlier clinical studies with no new safety signals identified.1,2,3,4,5

The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab have not been established and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide. Bimekizumab is currently also being evaluated in Phase 3 trials for potential indications in psoriatic arthritis,6,7 ankylosing spondylitis,8 non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis9 and hidradenitis suppurativa.10,11

About Bimekizumab
Bimekizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.12 IL-17F has overlapping biology with IL-17A and drives inflammation independently to IL-17A.13,14,15,16,17 Selective inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A suppresses inflammation to a greater extent than IL-17A inhibition alone.10,11 The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab are being evaluated across multiple disease states as part of a robust clinical program.

About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory disease with primary involvement of the skin. This skin condition affects men and women of all ages and ethnicities.21 Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary but may include red patches of skin covered with silvery scales; dry, cracked skin that may bleed; and thickened, pitted or ridged nails.22

Psoriasis affects nearly three percent of the population, or about 125 million people worldwide.21 Unmet needs remain in the treatment of psoriasis. A population-based survey identified that approximately 30 percent of psoriasis patients reported that their primary goals of therapy, including keeping symptoms under control, reducing itching and decreasing flaking, were not met with their current treatment.23 Psoriasis has a considerable psychological and quality of life impact, potentially affecting work, recreation, relationships, sexual functioning, family and social life.24

Forward looking statements UCB
This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

The FDA has recognized the potential of therapy and recommends a pivotal confirmatory study to augment the existing STRONG data, further supporting the regulatory submission for IT formulation
 The new study will not be initiated in the US until the FDA has lifted the hold while the request for a study is unrelated to the partial clinical hold on AVXS-101 IT. Trial design and other details are being evaluated and an update on the overall SMA program will be provided following the discussions with health authorities
 Zolgensma is an approved therapy in the US, Japan, and Brazil for patients with SMA under the age of two. The company is also evaluating branaplam (LMI070, PO, qw) RNA splicing modulator to expand the treatment options for SMA patients","Novartis Gene Therapies to initiate new pivotal confirmatory study to evaluate use of AVXS-101 intrathecal (IT) formulation in older patients with SMA to further support registration

Basel, September 23, 2020 – Novartis Gene Therapies recently received feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following their review of data from the STRONG study of the intrathecal (IT) formulation of AVXS-101 in older patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The FDA has acknowledged the potential of AVXS-101 IT in this patient population and recommends a pivotal confirmatory study to supplement the existing STRONG data and further support the regulatory submission for AVXS-101 IT.

This guidance provides clarity on the path to registration for AVXS-101 IT. Trial design and other details are being evaluated and a comprehensive update on the overall Novartis SMA clinical development program will be provided at a future time following further discussions with health authorities. This request for a study is unrelated to the partial clinical hold on AVXS-101 IT, and the new study will not be initiated in the US until the hold has been lifted by the FDA. Novartis Gene Therapies remains confident in the overall benefit-risk profile for patients on treatment. This does not impact marketed Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) and the company continues to advance its regulatory filings and intravenous clinical studies.

Novartis Gene Therapies reaffirms its commitment to the SMA community and to pursuing solutions for patients with all types of SMA, including older children and adults. All patients deserve a gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of their disease with a single dose.

Zolgensma is approved in the US, Japan and, most recently, Brazil, for patients with SMA under the age of two. Zolgensma also continues to have a strong launch in Europe where it is approved for babies and young children with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1 or SMA with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene, with dosing guidance provided up to 21 kg. More than 600 patients have benefited from Zolgensma, including through clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. This number is expected to continue to grow as this transformative gene therapy is approved in additional markets and as the company pursues additional studies to fully explore the impact of Zolgensma across a broad population of patients with SMA.

The company’s commitment to SMA extends beyond gene therapy to branaplam (LMI070), an oral, once-weekly RNA splicing modulator also currently under development, to expand the treatment options for SMA patients.

About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)
Zolgensma® is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2019 and represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. In addition to the US, Zolgensma is approved in Japan, Europe and Brazil. More than 600 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. Novartis Gene Therapies is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Israel, Australia, and South Korea in late-2020 or early 2021.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death. If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.
SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement. It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression. This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities. More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.

  Ide-cel is the first CAR T cell therapy accepted for regulatory review for multiple myeloma

PRINCETON, N.J., & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review their Biologics License Application (BLA) for idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel; bb2121), the companies’ investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 27, 2021.

“Today’s Priority Review milestone recognizes the potential of this first anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy to address a critical unmet need of patients with multiple myeloma,” said Stanley Frankel, M.D., senior vice president, Cellular Therapy Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are pleased by the significant progress that is being made in partnership with patients and the multiple myeloma community to bring ide-cel to adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who are triple-class exposed and may benefit from an important new therapeutic option.”

The BLA is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2 KarMMa study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in 128 adults with heavily pre-treated and highly refractory multiple myeloma exposed to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Results from the study were shared during an oral presentation as part of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.1

“Today’s acceptance of the BLA for ide-cel for Priority Review by the FDA marks a key moment in our journey to bring this BCMA-directed CAR T cell therapy to multiple myeloma patients who are in desperate need of new options,” said Joanne Smith-Farrell, Ph.D., chief operating officer oncology, bluebird bio. “Based on the body of evidence we have generated in an advanced, heavily pre-treated patient population, our confidence in the potential of ide-cel as an important treatment option remains high. Together with our partners at Bristol Myers Squibb, we are committed to continue working with the FDA to deliver this promising therapy to patients in an expeditious manner.”

Ide-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA, and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation and validation of its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Bristol Myers Squibb plans regulatory submissions for ide-cel in additional markets outside the U.S. and EU.

Ide-cel is not approved for any indication in any geography.

For Holders of Contingent Value Rights (CVR), Ticker BMY-RT

U.S. FDA approval of ide-cel by March 31, 2021 is one of the required remaining milestones of the Contingent Value Rights issued upon the close of the Celgene acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019. The other is U.S. FDA approval of liso-cel by December 31, 2020. The company is committed to working with FDA to progress both applications and achieve the remaining regulatory milestones required by the CVR.

About KarMMa

KarMMa (NCT03361748) is a pivotal, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multinational, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in North America and Europe. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Complete response rate is a key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints include time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease evaluated by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay and safety. The study enrolled 140 patients, of whom 128 received ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150-450 x 106 CAR+ T cells after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy. All enrolled patients had received at least three prior treatment regimens, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, and were refractory to their last regimen, defined as progression during or within 60 days of their last therapy.

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.2 The exact cause of multiple myeloma is not known and currently there is no cure, however, there are a number of treatment options available to help manage the disease.2 Patients who have already been treated with some available therapies but continue to have progression of their disease have “relapsed” and “refractory” multiple myeloma, meaning their cancer has returned after they have received initial treatments.3

About Ide-cel

Ide-cel is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy. The ide-cel CAR is comprised of a murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific for recognizing BCMA, attached to a human CD8 α hinge and transmembrane domain fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD137 4-1BB and CD3-ζ chain, in tandem. Ide-cel recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.

Ide-cel is being developed as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio.

48959,Micreos Initiates P-I/IIa Study Evaluating XZ.700 as the World's First Endolysin Therapy for Atopic Dermatitis,Micreos initiates clinical trial to evaluate world’s first endolysin-drug as a therapy for Atopic Dermatitis,"The company has enrolled the first patient in P-I/IIa Study assessing XZ.700 in 48 patients with mild to moderate AD in the Netherlands. This marks the world’s 1st evaluation of a pharmaceutical endolysin for topical use in humans
 The patients will be treated for 14 days with a cream containing XZ.700 at 3 different concentrations vs PBO. The company expects to complete the study and report the results trial by the end of 2021
 XZ.700 is an endolysin targeting S. aureus, including the antibiotic-resistant MRSA, while preserving Staphylococcus epidermidis, that is beneficial on the skin and helps in healing wounds. XZ.700 targets multiple indications including AD, diabetic wound infections, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma","THE HAGUE, Netherlands, Sept. 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Dutch biotech company Micreos Human Health has enrolled the first patients in a Phase I/IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treated dose-ranging study to assess the safety and efficacy of XZ.700 in patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The study marks the world’s first evaluation of a pharmaceutical endolysin for topical use in humans.

Endolysin XZ.700 killing S.aureus on the skin
Endolysins are highly specific enzymes that cut the bacterial cell wall, rapidly killing only the target bacteria, regardless of antibiotic resistance, while preserving the skin microbiome. XZ.700 specifically targets Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a bacterium that is considered to be a causative and aggravating trigger for atopic dermatitis, and viewed as an independent cause of itch, irritation and infection.

“The targeted removal of one particular bacterial species, S. aureus, from the skin microbiome, while preserving the beneficial ones is a fundamental new way to treat atopic dermatitis,” says dermatologist Dr. Peter Lio, Scientific Advisor for Micreos and Scientific Advisory Board member for the National Eczema Association. XZ.700 is one of several endolysins Micreos has in its portfolio. A structurally similar endolysin, SA.100, is used in the company’s over the counter (OTC) products for inflammatory skin disorders (e.g. acne and rosacea), found in the Gladskin range, which have been on the market since 2013. Data obtained in earlier Gladskin studies and feedback from doctors and thousands of customers support the pharmaceutical development program: “I am very encouraged by my experience with Gladskin and I am awaiting the findings with great anticipation.”

In this study, conducted in The Netherlands, XZ.700 will be tested for its safety as well as pharmacodynamics and efficacy in 48 patients with atopic dermatitis. They will be treated for 14 days with a cream containing XZ.700 at three different concentrations or placebo. Micreos expects to finish the study and report the results towards the end of 2021. More information about the study can be obtained at this link (www.trialregister.nl/trial/8876).

“Thanks to the targeted nature of endolysins and the fact that emergence of resistance is not expected, we can use them as effective precision tools in the post-antibiotic era, in both chronic and critical situations. With the start of the XZ.700 trial we take the technology to the next level and create tomorrow’s history,” says Mark Offerhaus, CEO Micreos.

About XZ.700

Endolysins are cell wall degrading enzymes, derived from naturally occurring phages. XZ.700 is Micreos’ endolysin in pharmaceutical development which targets S. aureus, including the antibiotic-resistant MRSA, while preserving Staphylococcus epidermidis, considered to be beneficial on the skin and conducive to wound healing. First targeted XZ.700 indications are Atopic Dermatitis, Diabetic Wound Infections caused by S. aureus, including MRSA, and Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma, targeting S. aureus as a possible trigger for malignancy in this form of cancer in the skin.

The company expects EC’s decision in Q4’20
 Supemtek is the first and only influenza vaccine to rely on recombinant manufacturing technology and is available in the US since 2017
 Additionally, CHMP also recommends the approval of MenQuadfi for active immunization of individuals aged ≥ 12yrs. against invasive meningococcal ACWY disease with expected EC’s decision by the end of 2020","Positive opinion based on clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy of Supemtek® for adults aged 18 and older demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials involving more than 10,000 patients
The European Commission (EC) final decision is expected in Q4 2020
Sanofi and GSK’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is based on the same technology platform
MEDIA UPDATE POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2020

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Supemtek® (recombinant influenza vaccine) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza in adults. A final decision is expected in Q4 2020.

The recommendation is based on clinical data demonstrating safety and efficacy of Supemtek demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials involving more than 10,000 patients. In comparison with a standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Supemtek reduced the risk of influenza by an additional 30% for adults aged 50 years and above.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing influenza remains a public health priority. as health authorities worldwide seek to prevent what is preventable: influenza and its potentially severe complications, and the burden this causes on healthcare systems.
The risk factors for influenza and COVID-19 overlap, with cases and complications predominantly seen in people above 65 years old, adults with obesity and underlying comorbidities1,2. This led many national and international recommending bodies to reinforce the need for influenza vaccination in this season2,3 – including the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization4,

Each year, influenza-associated deaths range from 290,000 to 650,0005,6 globally, and the burden on hospitals is around 10 million of influenza-related hospitalizations7.

Recent data also show that influenza can multiply the risk of heart attack by up to 10 times and the risk of stroke by up to 8 times in the week after influenza infection8, demonstrating that the burden of influenza goes beyond its well-known respiratory complications.

Supemtek is the first and only influenza vaccine to rely on recombinant manufacturing technology. This method for producing influenza vaccines differs significantly from the two other production platforms currently in use (egg-based and cell-based). Recombinant technology ensures an exact match of the hemagglutinin protein included in the vaccine to the influenza strains recommended seasonally by the World Health Organization for vaccines, which is an important factor when considering vaccine effectiveness.

Supemtek has been available in the US since 2017 – under Flublok brand name, with over ten million doses distributed since then.

This established technology is currently used for the development of one of Sanofi’s vaccines against COVID-19, developed in partnership with GSK and with the support of US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

The FDA submission is based on P-I/II ADVL0912 study assessing the maximum dose & clinical activity of therapy with r/r solid tumors ALCL
 The submission is also supported by the A8081013 study assessing Xalkori n pediatric and adult patients with advanced malignancies known to be ALK+ other than NSCLC and included patients with r/r ALCL. If approved, Xalkori would be the 1st biomarker-driven therapy for pediatric ALK+ ALCL
 The FDA’s submission is in addition to the EMA’s agreement on PIP for Xalkori for pediatric patients with r/r systemic ALK+ ALCL. Xalkori is a TKI indicated for metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ALK+ or ROS1+ as detected by an FDA-approved test and has received FDA’s BTD for the ALK+ ALCL in May’2018","If approved, XALKORI would be the first biomarker-driven therapy for Pediatric ALK-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted priority review to the Company’s supplemental New Drug Application(sNDA)for XALKORI® (crizotinib) for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive. XALKORI received Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for the ALK-positive ALCL indication in May 2018 and if approved, would be the first biomarker-driven therapy for this type of pediatric lymphoma. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is January 2020.

“Despite high survival rates for children with ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, many will relapse, requiring novel treatment approaches,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “Today’s FDA filing exemplifies Pfizer’s commitment to broadening the use of biomarker-driven therapies in areas with significant needs, such as rare, pediatric cancers. Given XALKORI’s proven efficacy in ALK-positive lung cancer and activity seen in clinical trials investigating relapsed or refractory ALK- and ROS-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, if approved, XALKORI could represent an important step toward improving outcomes for children with this type of cancer.”

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), divided into ALK-positive or ALK-negative disease.1,2 Though the five-year survival rate for children with cancer in the U.S. is now the highest it’s ever been at 80%, children with cancer continue to face challenges in treating their disease, including rare tumor types, variations in medicine response and prolonged risk of side effects. 3

“Children with cancer and their families have been desperate for new and innovative medicines. We applaud Pfizer’s commitment to drug discovery and development to help address childhood cancers, and continue to work together on behalf of patients with these cancers,” said George Dahlman, Chief Executive Officer, Children’s Cancer Cause. “We look forward to potentially having a new biomarker-driven therapy for children with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive ALCL that may help improve these children’s lives.”

The FDA submission is supported by the results from Study ADVL0912 (NCT00939770) and Study A8081013 (NCT01121588). Study ADVL0912 is a Phase 1/2 study conducted in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), evaluating the maximum dose that is safe and tolerable, and assessing clinical activity in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and ALCL. Pfizer provided funding and support to COG for this trial. Study A8081013 evaluated XALKORI in pediatric and adult patients with advanced malignancies known to be ALK-positive other than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and included patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL. These two studies showed compelling antitumor activity in pediatric and adult patients who received XALKORI.4,5 Please visit clinicaltrials.gov for more information on these studies.

This FDA submission is in addition to the European Medicines Agency’s agreement on a Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for XALKORI including the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive ALCL. This decision represents a step forward for potential regulatory submission for XALKORI in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive ALCL in the European Union.

The full prescribing information for XALKORI can be found here.

IMPORTANT XALKORI® (crizotinib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Hepatotoxicity: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials (n=1719). Increased transaminases generally occurred within the first 2 months. Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop increased transaminases. Permanently discontinue for ALT/AST elevation >3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin elevation >1.5 times ULN (in the absence of cholestasis or hemolysis); otherwise, temporarily suspend and dose-reduce XALKORI as indicated.

Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1719), 2.9% of XALKORI-treated patients had any grade ILD, 1.0% had Grade 3/4, and 0.5% had fatal ILD. ILD generally occurred within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis.

QT Interval Prolongation: QTc prolongation can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1616), 2.1% of patients had QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) ≥500 ms and 5% of 1582 patients had an increase from baseline QTcF ≥60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECGs. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms or ≥60 ms change from baseline with Torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia. Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms on at least 2 separate ECGs until recovery to a QTc ≤480 ms, then resume at next lower dosage.

Bradycardia: Symptomatic bradycardia can occur. Across clinical trials, bradycardia occurred in 13% of patients treated with XALKORI (n=1719). Avoid use in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If bradycardia occurs, re-evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening bradycardia due to XALKORI; however, if associated with concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥60 bpm. If concomitant medications can be adjusted or discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent monitoring.

Severe Visual Loss: Across clinical trials, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with vision loss was 0.2% of 1719 patients. Discontinue XALKORI in patients with new onset of severe visual loss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes). Perform an ophthalmological evaluation. There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients with a severe visual loss; a decision to resume should consider the potential benefits to the patient.

Vision Disorders: Most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. 0.8% of patients had Grade 3 and 0.2% had Grade 4 visual impairment. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4-7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact on daily activities.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 45 days (females) or 90 days (males) respectively, following the final dose of XALKORI.

ROS1-positive Metastatic NSCLC: Safety was evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study, and was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in the ROS1 study; 90% of patients had Grade 1 vision disorders and 2% had Grade 2.

Adverse Reactions: Safety was evaluated in a phase 3 study in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC randomized to XALKORI (n=171) or chemotherapy (n=169). Serious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI, the most frequent were dyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% of patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥25% and more commonly (≥5%) in patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were vision disorder (71% vs 10%), diarrhea (61% vs 13%), edema (49% vs 12%), vomiting (46% vs 36%), constipation (43% vs 30%), upper respiratory infection (32% vs 12%), dysgeusia (26% vs 5%), and abdominal pain (26% vs 12%). Grade 3/4 reactions occurring at a ≥2% higher incidence with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were QT prolongation (2% vs 0%), esophagitis (2% vs 0%), and constipation (2% vs 0%). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, the following occurred: elevation of ALT (any grade [79% vs 33%] or Grade 3/4 [15% vs 2%]); elevation of AST (any grade [66% vs 28%] or Grade 3/4 [8% vs 1%]); neutropenia (any grade [52% vs 59%] or Grade 3/4 [11% vs 16%]); lymphopenia (any grade [48% vs 53%] or Grade 3/4 [7% vs 13%]); hypophosphatemia (any grade [32% vs 21%] or Grade 3/4 [10% vs 6%]). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, renal cysts occurred (5% vs 1%). Nausea (56%), decreased appetite (30%), fatigue (29%), and neuropathy (21%) also occurred in patients taking XALKORI.

Drug Interactions: Use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If concomitant use of XALKORI is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling.

Lactation: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the final dose.

Hepatic Impairment: Crizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre-existing moderate (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5x ULN and ≤3x ULN) or severe (any AST and total bilirubin >3x ULN) hepatic impairment. Reduce XALKORI dosage in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of XALKORI in patients with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment is 200 mg orally twice daily or with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment is 250 mg orally once daily.

Renal Impairment: Decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in patients treated with XALKORI. Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg taken orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) not requiring dialysis.

Based on these results and following discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ENSEMBLE will enroll up to 60,000 volunteers across three continents and will study the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose versus placebo in preventing COVID-19.

Johnson & Johnson has continued the scaling up of its manufacturing capacity and remains on track to meet its goal of providing one billion doses of a vaccine each year. The Company is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use and anticipates the first batches of a COVID-19 vaccine to be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021, if proven to be safe and effective.

Johnson & Johnson will develop and test its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles. The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study – including the study protocol.

“As COVID-19 continues to impact the daily lives of people around the world, our goal remains the same – leveraging the global reach and scientific innovation of our company to help bring an end to this pandemic,” said Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “As the world’s largest healthcare company, we are bringing to bear our best scientific minds, and rigorous standards of safety, in collaboration with regulators, to accelerate the fight against this pandemic. This pivotal milestone demonstrates our focused efforts toward a COVID-19 vaccine that are built on collaboration and deep commitment to a robust scientific process. We are committed to clinical trial transparency and to sharing information related to our study, including details of our study protocol.”

“We remain fully focused on developing an urgently needed, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for people around the world,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We greatly value the collaboration and support from our scientific partners and global health authorities as our global team of experts work tirelessly on the development of the vaccine and scaling up our production capacity with a goal to deliver a vaccine for emergency use authorization in early 2021.”

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Company’s AdVac® technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission approved Ebola vaccine and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. Janssen’s AdVac® technology platform has been used to vaccinate more than 100,000 people to date across Janssen’s investigational vaccine programs.

With Janssen’s AdVac® technology, the vaccine, if successful, is estimated at launch to remain stable for two years at -20 °C and at least three months at 2-8° C. This makes the vaccine candidate compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and would not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it.

PHASE 3 ENSEMBLE STUDY

The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose versus placebo in up to 60,000 adults 18 years old and older, including significant representation from those that are over age 60. The trial will include those both with and without comorbidities associated with an increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, and will aim to enroll participants in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and the United States. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine, countries and clinical trial sites which have a high incidence of COVID-19 and the ability to achieve a rapid initiation will be activated.

Built on a legacy of purpose-driven actions and a commitment to diversity and inclusion, the Company aims to achieve representation of populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic in the implementation of its COVID-19 Phase 3 trial program. In the U.S., this includes significant representation of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian and Alaskan Native participants.

ENSEMBLE is being initiated in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Other Transaction Agreement HHSO100201700018C, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at HHS.

In parallel, the Company has also agreed in principle to collaborate with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK Government) on a separate Phase 3 clinical trial in multiple countries to explore a two-dose regimen of Janssen’s vaccine candidate.

“With our vaccine candidate now in our global Phase 3 trial, we are one step closer to finding a solution for COVID-19. We used a highly scientific and evidence-based approach to select this vaccine candidate. We are extremely grateful for the tireless efforts of our researchers and for the vital contributions of those participants who have volunteered to take part in our studies. Together, we are working to help combat this pandemic,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Johnson & Johnson.

The Company is in ongoing discussions with many stakeholders, including national governments and global organizations, as part of its efforts to meet its commitment to make the vaccine candidate accessible globally, provided the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective and following regulatory approval.

BERKELEY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Siemens Healthineers announced today a master collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to design, develop, and commercialize diagnostic tests for therapeutic products across Novartis’ therapeutic pipeline. The initial program assists the development of a serum NfL immunoassay to support Novartis’ MS and other neuroscience programs.

“We are looking forward to our collaboration with Novartis as it promises to yield innovative diagnostic solutions to address critical unmet clinical needs”

NfL is a highly specific biomarker for nerve cell injury measured in cerebral spinal fluid and blood. Blood NfL levels have been reported to change in a variety of serious neurological conditions, including MS and have been related to disease activity and disability outcomes.1

MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord.2 The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that more than 2.5 million people in the world and more than 400,000 people in the United States have MS. By 2025, an estimated $23 billion will be spent annually on treating the disease.3

Novartis, as a leading pharmaceutical company in neuroscience, has a strong ongoing commitment to bring transformative treatments to people suffering from neurological conditions, such as MS, where there is a high unmet need.

This collaboration will leverage Siemens Healthineers’ expertise in the development of innovative clinical diagnostic solutions that can run on Siemens Healthineers global population of ADVIA Centaur and Atellica immunoassay platforms designed for use in hospitals, reference laboratories, and specialty laboratories.

“We are looking forward to our collaboration with Novartis as it promises to yield innovative diagnostic solutions to address critical unmet clinical needs,” said Deepak Nath, PhD, President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers. “Our initial focus on blood-based diagnostic solutions for MS patients is another example of Siemens Healthineers commitment to shape the future of precision medicine.”

The global burden of chronic neurological diseases4 continues to increase, and a 2016 study concluded that neurology disorders are the second leading cause of death and leading cause of DALYs (disability-adjusted life-year). Serum NfL would expand Siemens Healthineers Laboratory Diagnostics Neurology test menu, which also targets AB42 and Tau assays for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The Siemens Healthineers AB42 and Tau assays were recently granted FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for expedited reviews.

Additionally, Siemens Healthcare Laboratory, based in Berkeley, CA, offers a range of neurobiomarker testing services, including serum NfL, for biopharmaceutical company therapy development programs. Siemens Healthineers also offers a comprehensive range of Neuroradiology products and services.

AC Immune remains in a strong financial position with operations fully financed through Q1 2024

LAUSANNE, Switzerland,, Sept. 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AC Immune SA (NASDAQ: ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has informed the Company of top line results from a Phase 2 trial of the anti-Tau antibody, semorinemab, in early (prodromal to mild) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which show that semorinemab did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of reducing decline on Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared to placebo. Two secondary endpoints, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) were also not met.

Additional data analyses are ongoing and Genentech plans to present the results from TAURIEL at an upcoming medical congress. The second Phase 2 (LAURIET) study of semorinemab in patients with moderate AD remains ongoing.

Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune SA, commented: “Today’s news is surprising and disappointing, given what we as a field know about Tau and its strong spatiotemporal correlation with both symptoms and pathology in AD. We believe the full data analysis of this first-of-its-kind study will yield information about this promising target that will advance our understanding and inform future efforts to successfully develop effective therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). We would like to thank the patients, caregivers and investigators who participated in this important, ground-breaking trial and look forward to the final results from our partner, Genentech.”

Prof. Pfeifer continued, “Our proprietary technology platforms and proven business model of discovery, early development and partnering high-risk therapeutic candidates for AD have successfully generated CHF 334 million in non-dilutive funding and enabled us to accelerate clinical development of our product candidates in collaboration with world-leading partners. This strategy enables us to focus our resources on advancing the next generation of first-in-class or best-in-class assets. With current funding through Q1 2024, this robust risk-and-financial-sharing strategy will continue unaffected as we work diligently to mature our proprietary candidates and generate substantial future value for the Company.”

“One of AC Immune’s key strengths is our diversified approach and our broad pipeline of assets, fueled by our remarkably efficient SupraAntigen™ and Morphomer™ platforms and staff. This is evidenced by our novel therapeutic candidates targeting TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein, which have advanced rapidly from discovery into IND-enabling studies. Furthermore, we are particularly pleased with progress in our recently disclosed discovery program targeting the NLRP3–ASC inflammasome,” Prof. Pfeifer added.

Both TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein are major pathologies in NDD and are increasingly thought to be important co-pathologies in AD. AC Immune’s programs directed towards these targets are the most advanced and comprehensive in the field. AC Immune’s alpha-synuclein positron emission tomography (PET) tracer program for Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnostics was recently recognized by the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) award. Activation of the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome leads to chronic and uncontrolled inflammation, which is understood to drive a number of neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. AC Immune’s approach has high potential for effective therapies, in NDD and non-NDD as mono- and/or combination therapy.

Broad Pipeline and Upcoming Milestones in 2020
AC Immune’s additional anti-Tau clinical assets are outlined below as well as additional milestone tables from the broader pipeline.

ACI-35.030 (anti-Tau vaccine): ACI-35.030 is the first anti-phospho-Tau (pTau) vaccine to reach Phase 2 clinical development. The vaccine generates a polyclonal antibody response that targets epitopes that differ from the epitope targeted by the monoclonal semorinemab. Importantly, these epitopes include an epitope specific to pTau, which is the pathological form of Tau protein responsible for the formation of tangles in AD. Additionally, the antibodies generated by this active immunization approach have pharmacokinetic properties that differ from those of injected semorinemab.
ACI-3024 (anti-Tau inhibitor): ACI-3024 is a first-in-class small molecule that passes through cell membranes to allow for the inhibition of intracellular Tau aggregates, which is not easily achieved with a large antibody like semorinemab. Phase 1 results in healthy volunteers and data disclosure are expected by Eli Lilly and Company in 2020.
Tau- PET tracer: AC Immune’s Tau-PET tracer has the potential to work as a critical tool in the further development of anti-Tau approaches by facilitating the design of clinical trials that hit on two key aspects of AC Immune’s Roadmap to Successful Therapies for Neurodegenerative Diseases – treating earlier and targeting more homogeneous populations. PI-2620 is currently being evaluated in a longitudinal Phase 2 study in patients with AD and a Phase 1 study (test/retest) in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
Details of the TAURIEL study
The Phase 2 TAURIEL study of semorinemab is a 73-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if it can slow the rate of clinical decline in early (prodromal to mild) AD. The study followed 457 participants across 97 study centers. The study did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of reducing decline on Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared to placebo, but did meet the primary safety endpoint. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar between semorinemab and placebo arms and further analysis of these safety data are currently underway. Two secondary endpoints, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) also were not met. Analysis of additional data, including biomarkers such as Tau-PET, are ongoing and Genentech plans to present the results from the study at an upcoming medical congress. The second Phase 2 (LAURIET) study of semorinemab, in a different patient population, moderate AD, is ongoing.
