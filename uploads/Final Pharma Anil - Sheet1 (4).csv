About COPD

COPD is a progressive and life-threatening respiratory disease without a cure. It is the third leading cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization. The condition damages the airways and the lungs, leading to debilitating breathlessness that has a devastating impact on performing basic daily activities such as getting out of bed, showering, eating and walking. U.S. sales of medicines used for chronic maintenance therapy of COPD were $9.6 billion in 2019. About 1.2 million U.S. COPD patients on dual/triple inhaled therapy, long-acting beta-agonist (“LABA”)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) +/- inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”) remain uncontrolled, experiencing symptoms that impair quality of life. These patients urgently need better treatments.

About Ensifentrine

Ensifentrine (RPL554) is an investigational, first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 (“PDE3” and “PDE4”). This dual inhibition enables it to combine both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects in one compound. Ensifentrine also activates the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (“CFTR”), which is beneficial in reducing mucous viscosity and improving mucociliary clearance. Ensifentrine’s mechanism of action has the potential to alleviate respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness and cough and work against inflammation associated with COPD or inflammation triggered by viruses.

Ensifentrine has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both lung function and symptoms, including breathlessness, in Verona Pharma’s Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”). In addition, nebulized ensifentrine showed further improved lung function and reduced lung volumes in COPD patients taking standard short- and long-acting bronchodilator therapy, including maximum bronchodilator treatment with dual/triple therapy. Ensifentrine has been well tolerated in clinical trials involving more than 1,300 subjects to date.

About Verona Pharma

Verona Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs. If successfully developed and approved, Verona Pharma’s product candidate, ensifentrine, has the potential to be the first therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases that combines bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory activities in one compound. The Company is evaluating nebulized ensifentrine in its Phase 3 clinical program ENHANCE (“Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD thErapy”) for COPD maintenance treatment. The Company raised gross proceeds of $200 million through a private placement in July 2020 and expects the funds to support its operations and Phase 3 clinical program into 2023. Two additional formulations of ensifentrine are currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of COPD: dry powder inhaler (“DPI”) and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (“pMDI”). Ensifentrine is in a pilot clinical study in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and has potential applications in cystic fibrosis, asthma and other respiratory diseases.

Novavax has continued to scale-up its manufacturing capacity, currently up to 2B annually","Clinical trial to enroll up to 10,000 volunteers across the UK to assess whether NVX-CoV2373 is effective in the prevention of COVID-19
GAITHERSBURG, Md., Sept. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced that it has initiated its first Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), in partnership with the UK Government’s Vaccines Taskforce, and is expected to enroll and immunize up to 10,000 individuals between 18-84 (inclusive) years of age, with and without relevant comorbidities, over the next four to six weeks.

“With a high level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission observed and expected to continue in the UK, we are optimistic that this pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial will enroll quickly and provide a near-term view of NVX-CoV2373’s efficacy,” said Gregory M. Glenn, M.D., President, Research and Development at Novavax. “The data from this trial is expected to support regulatory submissions for licensure in the UK, EU and other countries. We are grateful for the support of the UK Government, including from its Department of Health and Social Care and National Institute for Health Research, to advance this important research.”

NVX-CoV2373 is a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ recombinant protein nanoparticle technology that includes Novavax’ proprietary MatrixM™ adjuvant. The vaccine has a favorable product profile that will allow handling in an unfrozen, liquid formulation that can be stored at 2°C to 8°C, allowing for distribution using standard vaccine channels.

Novavax has continued to scale-up its manufacturing capacity, currently at up to 2 billion annualized doses, once all capacity has been brought online by mid-2021.

About the Phase 3 Study

Consistent with its long-standing commitment to transparency and in order to enhance information-sharing during the worldwide pandemic, Novavax will be publishing its UK study protocol in the coming days.

The UK Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M in up to 10,000 subjects aged 18 to 84 years. Half the participants will receive two intramuscular injections of vaccine comprising 5 µg of protein antigen with 50 µg Matrix‑M adjuvant, administered 21 days apart, while half of the trial participants will receive placebo.

The trial is designed to enroll at least 25 percent of participants over the age of 65 as well as to prioritize groups that are most affected by COVID-19, including racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, up to 400 participants will also receive a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine as part of a co-administration sub-study.

The trial has two primary endpoints. The first primary endpoint is first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second study vaccination in volunteers who have not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The second primary endpoint is first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second study vaccination in volunteers who have not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The primary efficacy analysis will be an event-driven analysis based on the number of participants with symptomatic or moderate/severe COVID-19 disease. An interim analysis will be performed when 67% of the desired number of these cases has been reached.

About NVX-CoV2373

NVXCoV2373 is a vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARSCoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. NVXCoV2373 was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. NVX-CoV2373 contains purified protein antigens and cannot replicate, nor can it cause COVID-19. In preclinical trials, NVXCoV2373 demonstrated indication of antibodies that block binding of spike protein to receptors targeted by the virus, a critical aspect for effective vaccine protection. In its the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial, NVXCoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera. NVX-CoV2373 is also being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 2 studies, which began in August; a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, and a Phase 1/2 continuation in the U.S. and Australia. Novavax has secured $2 billion in funding for its global coronavirus vaccine program, including up to $388 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

About Matrix-M™

Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response.

49169,Roche's Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) Receives Health Canada's Approval For R/R Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma,Health Canada Grants Market Authorization to Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma,"Health Canada, under (NOC/c) policy, has granted market authorization to Polivy + bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for six 21-day cycles in adult patients with r/r DLBCL, who are not eligible for ASCT and prior treated with at least one therapy
 The approval is based on P-I/II GO29365 study assessing Polivy + BR vs BR alone in 80 patients, including 4 Canadians with previously treated DLBCL. Results: patients achieving CR or PR (40% vs 18%); mDoR (12.6 vs 7.7mos.)
 Polivy is an ADC, targeting CD79b and destroys the B cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, while minimizing the effects on normal cells","First-in-class antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets CD79b and destroys B cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent ii,iii

MISSISSAUGA, ON, Sept. 24, 2020 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) is pleased to announce that on July 9, 2020, Health Canada, under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy, has granted market authorization to Polivy™(polatuzumab vedotin), in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified, who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant and have received at least one prior therapy.i

DLBCL is an aggressive and fast-growing form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). While it is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline, as many as 40 per cent of patients do not respond to initial treatment or relapse, at which time therapy options are limited and survival is short.iv

Health Canada’s Notice of Compliance with Conditions policy provides conditional authorization for new drugs with promising evidence of clinical effectiveness, for patients suffering from serious, life- threatening or severely debilitating diseases or conditions for which no drug is presently marketed in Canada or for which a significant increase in efficacy or a significant decrease in risk is demonstrated in relation to an existing drug marketed in Canada.v Prior to authorization, the sponsor must undertake to design, carry out and report on confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit of the drug.v 

“Despite the significant advances made over the last few years in the treatment of lymphoma, people with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly those who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation, continue to have limited options,” said Dr. Laurie Sehn, Chair, Lymphoma Tumour Group, BC Cancer Agency, and a clinical investigator on the GO29365 study. “I am pleased a much needed new and effective option is available in Canada to combat this aggressive form of lymphoid cancer.”

This new authorization is based on the results from the phase I/II GO29365 study, an international, multicenter, open-label, Phase Ib/II trial.i  Results showed that 40 per cent of people treated with Polivy plus BR achieved a complete or partial response, meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment (n=16/40; 95% CI: 25-57), compared to 18 per cent with BR alone (n=7/40; 95% CI: 7-33).vi The study also showed the median duration of responsiveness to treatment was 12.6 months for patients in the Polivy plus BR arm (n=12/25) versus 7.7 months for patients in the BR arm (n=2/10).vi

“Many DLBCL patients who have relapsed following first line or subsequent lines of therapy are ineligible for stem cell transplant, and there is a need for new treatment options for this patient group,” said Kaitlyn Beyfuss-Laski, Manager of Patient Programs, Research and Advocacy at Lymphoma Canada. “The combination of polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) with bendamustine and rituximab provides a new tool for this group of patients. We are so pleased that new treatment options are available to relapsed DLBCL patients in Canada.”

About the GO29365 study

GO29365 is an international, multicenter, open-label, Phase Ib/II trial which included a randomized cohort of 80 patients, including four Canadians with previously treated DLBCL. Eligible patients were not candidates for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at study entry, had relapsed or refractory disease after receiving at least one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen, and had an ECOG PS ≤2. In this study, patients were randomized to receive Polivy plus BR (n=40) or BR alone (n=40) for six 21-day cycles. The median age was 69 years (range 30 to 86 years) and 71 per cent of patients were white and 66 per cent were male. The primary endpoint of the study was complete response (CR) rate at end of treatment (6 to 8 weeks after day 1 of cycle 6 or last study treatment) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Efficacy was based on the primary endpoint, complete response (CR) rate at the end of treatment as assessed by IRC. Key supportive efficacy endpoints were objective response rate at the end of treatment and best overall response rate. Duration of response was also assessed in the study.i

The most frequently-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with DLBCL treated with Polivy in combination with BR were anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, decreased appetite, neuropathy peripheral, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and pyrexia. Serious adverse events were reported in 64.4 per cent of Polivy plus BR treated patients which included febrile neutropenia (11.1%), pyrexia (8.9%), pneumonia (8.9%), anemia (4.4%), duodenal ulcer hemorrhage (4.4%), sepsis (4.4%), and thrombocytopenia (4.4%).i

About Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin)

Polivy is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that combines the targeting ability of antibodies with chemotherapies to destroy cancer cells.ii,iii It specifically targets CD79b, a protein expressed in the majority of B cells and destroys the B cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, while minimizing the effects on normal cells.ii,iii,vii Polivy offers a fixed-duration of treatment of six cycles through IV infusion, with each cycle lasting 21 days.i

About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

DLBCL is the most common form of NHL that develops when the body makes abnormal B cells.viii It accounts for up to 30 to 40 percent of cases of NHL in Canada each year, with an estimated 150,000 diagnosed worldwide each year.ix,x It can occur at any age, however most people are diagnosed when they are in their mid-60s.viii It is also slightly more common in men than in women.viii Despite meaningful progress in the treatment of DLBCL, treatment options are very limited when the disease is refractory to or recurrent after multiple regimens.xi This makes DLBCL increasingly harder to treat after each relapse, resulting in poor prognosis with median overall survival of around six months.xi

49191,Medtronic Evaluates Insertable Cardiac Monitor to Identify Patients at High Risk of Worsening Heart Failure,Medtronic Evaluates Insertable Cardiac Monitor in Identifying Patients at High Risk of Worsening Heart Failure,"Medtronic enrolls the first patient in the ALLEVIATE-HF clinical trial assessing the ability of its Reveal LINQ ICM in identifying patients at high risk of worsening HF. The study will enroll ~300 patients at up to 30 sites across the US for a minimum of 7mos.and up to 3yrs.
  The focus of the study is to determine if early information provided by the LINQ devices enables clinicians to act before patients’ conditions worsen. The ICM allows physicians to monitor a patient’s heart continuously and wirelessly for arrhythmia disorder
 The Reveal LINQ ICM is ~ one-third the size of a AAA battery (~1 cc) and is placed just beneath the skin through a small incision of less than 1 cm in the upper left side of the chest, using a minimally invasive procedure. ALLEVIATE-HF trial is the first to study the use of an ICM to manage heart failure in a remote setting","DUBLIN, Sept. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced first enrollments in the ALLEVIATE-HF clinical trial which will evaluate the ability of its Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) in identifying patients at high-risk of worsening heart failure. The trial will determine if early information provided by the LINQ devices enable clinicians to take action before patients’ conditions worsen. The LINQ device will alert clinicians if a patient is at high risk for a heart failure event, allowing time for a physician to adjust medications to enhance patient health.

The Reveal LINQ ICM allows physicians to continuously and wirelessly monitor a patient’s heart for arrhythmia disorders. With a proprietary algorithm added to the Reveal LINQ system for this study, clinicians will be alerted to signs of worsening heart failure. They will receive the information via nightly transmissions delivered to the Medtronic CareLink® Network from patients’ bedside monitors. Patient data will be stratified by risk level, providing physicians remote access to patient data and allowing them to intervene earlier than possible without this system.

The first patients were enrolled at Cardiology Associates of North Mississippi by Dr. Barry Bertolet, and Florida Heart Center by Dr. Prasad Chalasani. The trial is a prospective, randomized, multisite, interventional, investigational device exemption (IDE) study that will enroll up to 300 patients at up to 30 sites across the United States. Patients will be followed a minimum of seven months and up to three years. With the commencement of the ALLEVIATE-HF trial, Medtronic is the first to study the use of an ICM to manage heart failure in a remote setting.

Heart failure affects approximately 6.2 million Americans and causes or contributes to an estimated 380,000 deaths per year in the United States alone.1 The condition occurs when the heart isn’t pumping enough blood to meet the body’s needs. As a result, fluid may build up in the legs, lungs, and in other tissues throughout the body, leaving patients feeling tired or experiencing shortness of breath. Therapeutic options for those with heart failure may include medication, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

“It’s vital that clinicians know about the early warning signs of worsening heart failure, and this study will help us determine if the new LINQ algorithm will identify that information so we can take action,” said Javed Butler, M.D., chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi, and chair of ALLEVIATE-HF Steering Committee. “Remote monitoring may transform treatment and personalize the ongoing management of patients, and we look forward to having more evidence to help physicians proactively manage their patients, even without a face-to-face visit.”

The Reveal LINQ ICM is approximately one-third the size of a AAA battery (~1 cc) and is placed just beneath the skin through a small incision of less than 1 cm in the upper left side of the chest, using a minimally invasive procedure. The device communicates wirelessly with a patient bedside monitor that uploads device data to the CareLink Network; it is MR-Conditional, allowing patients to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if needed. The remote monitoring feature of the LINQ device could potentially reduce unnecessary in-office visits since physicians have remote access to patient data. Medtronic introduced the world’s first remote cardiac monitoring system in 2002, and it has been implanted in 1.3 million patients worldwide ever since.

“For two decades, Medtronic has been an innovator in cardiac monitoring, allowing for diagnosis and management in the home rather than the hospital environment,” said Rob Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “Heart failure management is a critical element in extending the capabilities of the LINQ platform beyond arrhythmia management to reach more patients with the right interventions before heart failure progresses. By initiating the ALLEVIATE-HF trial, Medtronic endeavors to help improve how clinicians receive actionable insights to better treat higher-risk patient populations.”

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.

 The study met its 1EPs of DFS in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 ≥1% and showed a reduction in risk of relapse in the adjuvant settings, safety profile is consistent with previous studies in solid tumors
 The company will continue the study as planned to allow for future analyses of 2EPs, including OS and disease-specific survival. Opdivo is a PD-1 immune check inhibitor harnessing the body’s own immune system to restore anti-tumor immune response","In an interim analysis, CheckMate -274 met primary endpoints of disease-free survival in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 ≥1%

Opdivo has now demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of three tumor types, including bladder cancer, melanoma and esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer

PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 ≥1% (programmed death-ligand 1). CheckMate -274 is the first and only Phase 3 trial in which immunotherapy has reduced the risk of relapse in the adjuvant setting for these patients.The safety profile of Opdivo was consistent with previously reported studies in solid tumors.

“With currently available therapies, more than 50% of patients with bladder cancer will experience recurrence after surgery, and each year, the disease takes the lives of nearly 200,000 patients,” said Matthew Galsky, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Director of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, Director of the Novel Therapeutics Unit, and Co-Director of the Center of Excellence for Bladder Cancer at The Tisch Cancer Institute and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “Advances like immunotherapy have helped bring hope to patients across a growing number of cancer types, including previously treated advanced urothelial carcinoma. The positive results from CheckMate -274 point to the potential for nivolumab to become a new standard of care in the adjuvant setting, extending disease-free survival for post-surgery patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer without the use of chemotherapy.”

“As we advance the science of immunotherapy, we’re discovering that these treatments may play an important role in earlier stages of cancer, when the immune system is generally more intact and potentially more responsive,” said Mark Rutstein, Vice President, Opdivo Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “With the positive results from CheckMate -274, Opdivo has now demonstrated improved efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of three tumor types, including bladder cancer, melanoma and esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer, as part of our broad development program across earlier stages of cancer. We would like to thank the patients and investigators who participated in the trial and contributed to our collective scientific understanding.”

The company plans to complete a full evaluation of the CheckMate -274 data, work with investigators to present the results at an upcoming medical conference, and submit the data to health authorities. The CheckMate -274 trial will continue as planned to allow for future analyses of secondary endpoints, including overall survival and disease-specific survival.

CheckMate -274 is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multi-center study evaluating Opdivo compared to placebo in participants with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer at a high risk of recurrence after radical surgery. Depending on patient characteristics, enrolled patients may or may not have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to resection. A total of 709 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Opdivo or placebo for up to one year. The primary endpoints of the trial are DFS in all randomized patients (i.e. the intention-to-treat population) and in the subset of patients whose tumors express PD-L1 ≥1%. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, non-urothelial tract recurrence free survival and disease-specific survival.

About Urothelial Carcinoma

Urothelial carcinoma, which most frequently begins in the cells that line the inside of the bladder, is the 10th most common cancer in the world, with approximately 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually. In addition to the bladder, urothelial carcinoma can occur in other parts of the urinary tract, including the ureters and renal pelvis. The majority of urothelial carcinomas are diagnosed at an early stage, but rates of recurrence and disease progression are high. More than 50% of patients who undergo surgery will experience disease recurrence. The poor durability of responses in the first-line metastatic setting presents a major challenge in the treatment of metastatic disease, and there are limited treatment options in the second-line setting for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

Bristol Myers Squibb: Advancing Cancer Research

At Bristol Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The goal of our cancer research is to increase patients’ quality of life, long-term survival and make cure a possibility. We harness our deep scientific experience, cutting-edge technologies and discovery platforms to discover, develop and deliver novel treatments for patients.

Building upon our transformative work and legacy in hematology and Immuno-Oncology that has changed survival expectations for many cancers, our researchers are advancing a deep and diverse pipeline across multiple modalities. In the field of immune cell therapy, this includes registrational CAR T cell agents for numerous diseases, and a growing early-stage pipeline that expands cell and gene therapy targets, and technologies. We are developing cancer treatments directed at key biological pathways using our protein homeostasis platform, a research capability that has been the basis of our approved therapies for multiple myeloma and several promising compounds in early- to mid-stage development. Our scientists are targeting different immune system pathways to address interactions between tumors, the microenvironment and the immune system to further expand upon the progress we have made and help more patients respond to treatment. Combining these approaches is key to delivering new options for the treatment of cancer and addressing the growing issue of resistance to immunotherapy. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines a reality for patients.

About Opdivo

Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.

Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.

In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur at any time after starting or discontinuing YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and before each dose. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity. In general, if YERVOY requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less followed by corticosteroid taper for at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Institute hormone replacement therapy for endocrinopathies as warranted.

“This novel thrombectomy system is the latest addition to Philips’ market-leading portfolio for the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral vascular diseases,” said Chris Landon, Senior Vice President and General Manager Image Guided Therapy Devices at Philips. “Its intuitive design simplifies the entire thrombectomy procedure workflow. By taking away the high initial capital expenditure costs associated with traditional mechanical thrombectomy systems, QuickClear can help bring cost-effective solutions to both the hospital and outpatient care settings.”
Simple, optimized performance
QuickClear simplifies the entire thrombectomy procedure workflow. The small footprint of the sterile device allows it to be placed easily and conveniently on the table next to the patient. With the touch of a button, the system is up and running at maximum aspiration power within seconds. The consistency of the aspiration power during the procedure provides physicians more control and supports faster procedure times. The system’s range of catheters includes a large 10F aspiration catheter, providing 59% more aspiration volume than 8F aspiration catheters [1].

 

“QuickClear is a simple and easy to use mechanical thrombectomy system,” said Bryan Fisher, MD, Chief of Vascular Surgery, Tristar Centennial Medical Center, Nashville, U.S. “The system is significantly smaller than other systems without compromising aspiration power. The convenience of the device really shines through with its single use and lack of capital equipment. I am excited about the potential of this device and the impact it will have on my practice and the patients I treat.”

 

Philips’ peripheral vascular portfolio already includes advanced interventional imaging systems for precision guidance; intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheters to assess the location of the disease and lesion morphology and guide and confirm the treatment; peripheral atherectomy devices to remove blockages; and peripheral therapy devices, such as Philips’ Stellarex drug-coated balloon, to treat lesions. Philips recently further extended this portfolio with the acquisition of Intact Vascular, maker of the Tack Endovascular System, a first-of-its-kind, minimal-metal, dissection repair device that provides precision treatment of peripheral arterial dissections following balloon angioplasty in above-the-knee (ATK) and below-the-knee (BTK) therapeutic interventions.

New Cardiovascular Horizons digital symposium
Today, September 24th at 19:00 ET Philips will host a symposium entitled ‘QuickClear Mechanical Thrombectomy System: A Powerfully Simple and Cost-Effective Solution’ as part of the New Cardiovascular Horizons (NCVH) digital education series. To register, visit here.

59% of infants were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds
No new safety signals were identified
In August, the FDA approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months and older

Basel, 28 September 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced new 2-year data from Part 1 of the pivotal FIREFISH study of Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) in infants aged 2-7 months with symptomatic Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The 2-year results in infants treated with the therapeutic dose of Evrysdi (17/21) showed that they continued to improve and achieve motor milestones.

This exploratory analysis showed that an estimated 88% of infants were alive and required no permanent ventilation at two years. In addition, at two years, 59% (10/17 vs. 7/17 at 1-year) of infants were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III). Sixty-five percent (11/17 vs. 9/17 at 1-year) had maintained upright head control, 29% (5/17 vs. 2/17 at 1-year) could turn themselves over and 30% (5/17 vs. 1/17 at 1-year) were able to stand either supporting weight or with support. After two years of treatment with Evrysdi, 71% (12/17 vs. 10/17 at 1-year) of infants achieved a CHOP-INTEND* score of 40 points or more and all infants increased their score from month 12 to month 24. Of the infants alive at two years (n=14), 100% maintained the ability to swallow and 93% (13/14) were able to feed orally. Safety for Evrysdi in the FIREFISH study was consistent with its previously reported safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. The most common adverse events (n=21) included fever (pyrexia; 71%), upper respiratory tract infection (52%), cough (33%), vomiting (33%), diarrhea (29%) and respiratory tract infection (29%). The most serious adverse event that occurred in 24% of infants was pneumonia.

“We are highly encouraged by the results we are seeing in the second year of treatment with Evrysdi,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “These results build on the efficacy and safety demonstrated by Evrysdi in pivotal trials, and we look forward to continued assessments of both survival and motor function during long-term follow up for this first-of-its-kind treatment.”

At the time of the analysis, the youngest infant was 28.4 months and the oldest was 45.1 months of age. The median age at enrollment was 6.3 months. Of the 17 infants treated with the therapeutic dose, two experienced fatal complications of their disease at 8 and 13 months of treatment and one infant was withdrawn from the study and sadly died 3.5 months later. None of these were attributed by the investigator as related to Evrysdi.

The data were presented at the virtual 25th International Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society.

Evrysdi is being studied in more than 450 people as part of a broad and robust clinical trial programme in SMA, with patients ranging from birth to 60 years old, and includes pre-symptomatic patients and those previously treated with other SMA-targeting therapies. Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining the production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

The FDA approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months of age and older. Risdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, Evrysdi has been filed in 16 international markets: Australia, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kuwait, Macedonia, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, four health authorities worldwide are currently reviewing the application: Canada, China, EU and Switzerland.

Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 2 years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint.

SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.
JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).
RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.
About SMA
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

FOSTER CITY, Calif. & TOKYO–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has granted Gilead K.K. (Tokyo, Japan) regulatory approval of Jyseleca® (filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg tablets), a once-daily, oral, JAK1 preferential inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapies, including the prevention of structural joint damage.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200924005942/en/

Gilead Japan will hold the marketing authorization of Jyseleca in Japan and will be responsible for product supply of Jyseleca in Japan, while Eisai will be responsible for product distribution of Jyseleca in Japan in RA. The companies will jointly commercialize the medicine to make it available to physicians and patients across Japan.

“Despite progress in the treatment of RA, existing therapies have not enabled many patients to reach the treatment goals recommended in clinical guidelines. There continues to be a need for effective and well-tolerated new treatment options,” said Tsutomu Takeuchi, MD, Professor of Internal Medicine and Chief of Rheumatology at the School of Medicine, Keio University. “Jyseleca is a new JAK inhibitor that, in clinical trials, has demonstrated clinical improvement, low disease activity and clinical remission in a broad patient population, including patients with inadequate response to biologics.”

“RA causes many patients debilitating fatigue and pain that can significantly interfere with their daily lives,” said Yoshiya Tanaka, MD, Professor at First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health. “It is important to have new treatment options that can offer patients effective symptom control and bring them new hope.”

The approval in Japan is based on robust clinical trial results from the global FINCH Phase 3 and DARWIN Phase 2 programs. The FINCH and DARWIN programs evaluated Jyseleca in more than 3,500 patients across a range of RA patient populations, including patients new to treatment and those who have demonstrated inadequate response to treatment with standard of care including biologic DMARDs. Patients receiving Jyseleca once daily showed improvements in clinical signs and symptoms, decreases in disease activity, and less progression of structural damage in their joints. Across the FINCH trials, Jyseleca demonstrated a consistent safety profile, and the frequency of adverse events of interest (including serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thromboembolism and major cardiovascular events) was comparable to control groups.

Across the FINCH and DARWIN trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection and dizziness. Rates of herpes zoster and pneumonia were 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. The exposure adjusted incidence rate of serious infections per 100 persons per year (95 percent CI) was 1.7 percent (1.3, 2.1) in the Jyseleca 200 mg group and 2.5 percent (1.9, 3.3) in the Jyseleca 100 mg group, respectively. When prescribing Jyseleca, physicians are advised to monitor patients for the development of new, or exacerbation of existing, serious infections including pneumonia, tuberculosis, sepsis and other viral infections.

“This regulatory approval recognizes the benefit that Jyseleca may be able to provide people living with RA who have not been successfully treated with prior therapies and represents an important advance in the treatment of this challenging disease,” said Luc Hermans, MD, President and Representative Director, Gilead Sciences, K.K.

“Now that Jyseleca has received approval in Japan, we look forward to leveraging our extensive experience in clinical development and commercialization in the RA area in Japan to bring this new treatment option to patients across Japan as soon as possible, and contribute to the improvement of patients’ quality of life,” said Hidenori Yabune, President of Eisai Japan, Senior Vice President, Eisai.

Gilead is developing Jyseleca in collaboration with Galapagos NV (Mechelen, Belgium (Nasdaq and EuroNext: GLPG)). The two companies are conducting global studies investigating the potential role of Jyseleca in a variety of diseases, including the previously reported Phase 3 SELECTION trial in ulcerative colitis.

About the FINCH Program

The FINCH Phase 3 program investigated the efficacy and safety of filgotinib 100 mg and 200 mg once-daily, in RA patient populations ranging from early stage to biologic-experienced patients. FINCH 1 was a 52-week, randomized, placebo- and adalimumab-controlled trial in combination with MTX, enrolling 1,759 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had inadequate response to MTX. The primary endpoint in FINCH 1 was ACR20 at Week 12. The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52. FINCH 2 was a global, 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluating filgotinib on a background of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug(s) (csDMARDs) among 449 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had not adequately responded to biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The primary endpoint in FINCH 2 was ACR20 at Week 12. FINCH 3 was a 52-week, randomized trial in 1,252 MTX-naïve patients to evaluate filgotinib 200 mg alone and filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg combined with MTX versus MTX alone. The primary endpoint in FINCH 3 was ACR20 at Week 24. The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52.

 Results: The pivotal P-III study demonstrated 50% fewer patients experienced a HES flare 28% vs 56%). The approval follows a PR of data from a clinical development program that included positive results from a pivotal P-III study
 Mepolizumab is a mAb targeting IL-5, it works by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils, reducing blood eosinophils to normal levels & it is first approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma","Third US indication for Nucala demonstrates GSK’s commitment to finding new ways to help patients with eosinophil-driven diseases
September 25, 2020 03:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time
LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Nucala (mepolizumab) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) for ≥ six months without an identifiable non-hematologic secondary cause. The approval makes Nucala the first and only targeted biologic treatment to be approved for patients with this eosinophil-driven disease in the US.

Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “HES is a complex, life-threatening condition that impacts nearly 5,000 patients in the US. Today’s approval gives these patients access to a biologic treatment for the first time and demonstrates our commitment to maximising Nucala’s impact on eosinophil-driven diseases.”

The FDA approval follows a priority review of data from a clinical development programme that included positive results from a pivotal phase 3 study, recently published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The study showed 50 percent fewer patients experienced a HES flare (worsening of symptoms or eosinophil threshold requiring an escalation in therapy) when treated with Nucala, compared to placebo, when added to standard of care treatment over the 32-week study period (28% vs 56%; p=0.002).

According to Dr. Gerald Gleich, MD, allergist, immunologist and a HES expert: “Patients with HES often suffer from debilitating flares of their disease. Reducing them is an important treatment goal. For the first time, we now have a biologic treatment option to offer appropriate patients with this complex disease.”

Patients with HES have a persistent and marked overproduction of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Reducing the overproduction of eosinophils to normal levels can help people with eosinophil-driven diseases such as HES.

Mary Jo Strobel, Executive Director, American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED) added: “HES can take many years to diagnose and most patients go through a long and frustrating journey that continues even after the diagnosis is confirmed as treatment roadmaps are often unclear and limited. APFED welcomes this approval of Nucala for HES as it gives our community hope.”

Nucala is currently used as an add-on maintenance therapy for severe eosinophilic asthma and for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and is being investigated in several other eosinophil-driven diseases.

About Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)

HES is a rare and under-diagnosed disorder, making it difficult to estimate its overall prevalence. Patients with HES have a persistent and marked overproduction of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. People with HES may have eosinophil levels three times greater than normal. When eosinophils infiltrate certain tissues, they can cause inflammation and organ damage which, over time, can impact patients’ day-to-day ability to function. Complications can range from fever and malaise to respiratory and cardiac problems. If left untreated, the symptoms of HES become progressively worse and the disease can be life-threatening.

About the phase 3 study

The pivotal phase 3 study, which enrolled 108 patients, was a 32-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous mepolizumab 300mg (3×100) every four weeks compared with placebo in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled HES. Uncontrolled HES was defined by at least two HES flares (worsening of symptoms or eosinophil threshold requiring an escalation in therapy) within the past 12 months and a blood eosinophil count of 1000 cells/µL or higher at screening.

About Nucala (mepolizumab)

First approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), mepolizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5. It is believed to work by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils, reducing blood eosinophils to normal levels. At normal levels eosinophils may play a role in maintaining health.

Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of diseases that are driven by inflammation caused by eosinophils. It has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 26 clinical trials across a number of eosinophilic indications and has been approved under the brand name Nucala in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets, as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with SEA. It is approved for paediatric use in SEA from ages six to 17 in Europe and the US and several other markets. In the US, Japan, Canada and a number of other markets, it is approved for use in adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Regulatory submissions for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) are expected to progress in 2020. Mepolizumab is currently being investigated in COPD. It is not currently approved for use in CRSwNP or COPD anywhere in the world.

Mepolizumab is not approved for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Full US Prescribing Information is available at US Prescribing Information Nucala.

Important safety information

The following information is based on the US Prescribing Information for Nucala in licensed indications only. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information for Nucala.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or excipients in the formulation.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of Nucala. Discontinue Nucala in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.
Do not use to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Herpes zoster infections have occurred in patients receiving Nucala. Consider vaccination if medically appropriate.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) in severe asthma clinical trials included headache, injection site reaction, back pain, and fatigue. Injection site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) occurred in 8% of subjects treated with 100 mg of Nucala versus 3% treated with placebo.

In a clinical trial in patients with EGPA receiving 300 mg of Nucala, no additional adverse reactions were identified to those reported in severe asthma clinical trials. Injection site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, swelling) occurred in 15% of subjects treated with 300 mg of Nucala versus 13% treated with placebo.

In a clinical trial in patients with Hypereosinophilic Syndrome, no additional adverse reactions were identified to those reported in the severe asthma trials. Injection site reactions (e.g., burning, itching) occurred in 7% of subjects treated with 300 mg of Nucala versus 4% treated with placebo.

 Tyvyt is a type of IgG4 mAb, that binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocking the PD-1 pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. The company is evaluating Tyvyt in 20+ studies across multiple cancer indications globally","SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China, Sept. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced the results of a Phase 3, open label, randomized study in China. The ORIENT-32 trial evaluating TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection, or IBI305) as a first-line treatment in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) met the predefined primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in an interim analysis. This is the first Phase 3 clinical trial using PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy that has met the primary endpoint in the first-line treatment of advanced HCC.

Based on the interim analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS and OS compared with sorafenib. The safety profile of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) in this trial was consistent with previously reported studies, and no new safety signals were identified. These data will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. Based on the IDMC recommendation, Innovent will review these results with the Drug Evaluation Center (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China.

The principal investigator of the ORIENT-32 study, Professor Fan Jia from Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, stated: “In China, HCC is the fourth most common malignancy with the second highest mortality rate. More than half of new and fatal cases of HCC in the world occur in China every year. At present, sorafenib, lenvatinib and chemotherapy are the main treatments for HCC in the first-line treatment setting in China, with very limited efficacy. About 85% of HCC patients in China have the history of HBV infection, which is a quite different feature from HCC in the European and American countries. Therefore, continued clinical research in treating HCC is of great importance in China. The ORIENT-32 study confirmed that TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection), can prolong PFS and OS in the first-line treatment of HCC. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, all study investigators worked to overcome many challenges to continue this trial with the goal of bringing new hope to HCC patients.”

Dr. Hui Zhou, Vice President and Head of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent stated: “TYVYT® is the only anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody included in the New Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List in China. It was officially approved by the NMPA on December 24, 2018 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy. BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) was officially approved by the NMPA for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer in China. The results of the ORIENT-32 study demonstrate the potential of TYVYT® in combination with BYVASDA® to treat patients with advanced HCC in the first-line setting. We hope this clinical trial can potentially provide a more effective treatment option for clinicians and HCC patients. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the patients and investigators who participated in the ORIENT-32 study. Outstanding contributions were made through the joint efforts of investigators and the study team, despite the challenges and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.

About ORIENT-32 Trial

ORIENT-32 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) compared to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 03794440). The primary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee (IRRC) based on RECIST v1.1.

Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combination with BYVASDA® (bevacizumab biosimilar injection) or sorafenib, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or other reasons stated in the protocol, whichever occurs first.

About Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a common malignancy of the digestive system worldwide, among which about half new cases and deaths occur in China. The main pathological types of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 85 to 90 percent, and a small number of cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and HCC-ICC mixed liver cancer. In China, HCC is primarily caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

About TYVYT® (Sintilimab Injection)

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is an innovative drug with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly in China. TYVYT® has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy and was included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies. TYVYT® is the only PD-1 inhibitor that has been included in the new Catalogue of the NRDL in November 2019.

In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the supplemental new drug application for TYVYT® in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT® combined with GEMZAR® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. TYVYT® monotherapy met the primary endpoint in the ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well. In August 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® in combination with GEMZAR® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.

TYVYT is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies with TYVYT® to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications globally, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

About BYVASDA® (Bevacizumab Biosimilar Injection)

BYVASDA® (IBI305) is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody drug. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors. An anti-VEGF antibody binds VEGF selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to VEGF receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt/PKB and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. BYVASDA® produces anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the growth, proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, blocking angiogenesis, reducing vascular permeability, blocking blood supply to tumor tissues, inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Since the launch of bevacizumab, it has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab have been well recognized worldwide.

NEWS PROVIDED BY

Sosei Heptares 

Sep 28, 2020, 03:25 ET

TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, England, Sept. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sosei Group Corporation (“the Company”) (TSE: 4565) has been notified by Pfizer that the first subject in a clinical trial has been dosed with a new drug candidate nominated from the multi-target drug discovery collaboration between the two companies. Achievement of this milestone triggers a payment of $5 million to Sosei Heptares. This candidate was nominated for advancement by Pfizer in June 2019 generating a $3 million milestone payment at that time.

Pfizer nominated three distinct clinical candidates from the collaboration with Sosei Heptares during 2019, two of which have now subsequently entered clinical trials. The collaboration has leveraged Sosei Heptares’ unique StaR® technology and Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) capabilities to design oral small molecules that modulate different G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targets across multiple disease areas of interest to Pfizer.

This candidate is the eighth GPCR-targeted drug candidate to enter clinical trials originating from Sosei Heptares’ StaR® technology and structure-based drug design (SBDD) platform.

Dr. Rob Cooke, Chief Technology Officer of Sosei Heptares, said: “The start of this new clinical trial is another great example of the productivity of our StaR® technology and structure-based drug design approach. It also highlights our ability to work collaboratively and successfully with leading pharma companies, applying cutting-edge complementary capabilities to discover and develop completely new drug candidates with potential to treat major diseases. We are extremely pleased with the progress being made in our long-term partnership with Pfizer.”

About the Agreement with Pfizer

Sosei Heptares and Pfizer entered a multi-target drug discovery collaboration in November 2015 to research and develop potential new medicines directed at up to ten GPCR targets across multiple therapeutic areas. Many of these targets have clinical or biological validation as key points for therapeutic intervention potentially targeting a range of diseases but have proven difficult to address with conventional discovery approaches because of inherent technical challenges.

To address these challenges, Sosei Heptares and Pfizer scientists worked closely together to leverage their respective complementary expertise in enabling GPCR-focused structure-based drug design (SBDD) and development initially directed to the GPCR targets selected by Pfizer.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced two-year follow up results from four Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) clinical trial participants who received SRP-9001 (AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin). SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of micro-dystrophin protein. Results presented at the 25th International Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society demonstrated that two years after a one-time infusion of SRP-9001, trial participants exhibited a mean 7.0 point improvement on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) compared to baseline.

“We continue to be encouraged by the safety profile and enduring treatment response that we have seen to date with SRP-9001 gene transfer therapy,” said Doug Ingram, President and CEO, Sarepta. “The consistent results and functional improvements sustained over two years give us added confidence as we prepare for the results from Study 102, our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SRP-9001. We continue to work with urgency to bring this potentially transformative treatment to patients as quickly as possible.”

In the open-label trial, known as Study 101, four ambulatory participants between the ages of 4 and 7 were treated with an infusion of SRP-9001 at a dose of 2x1014 vg/kg. The therapy was well-tolerated in all participants over the two-year time period. All adverse events were considered mild or moderate, and occurred within 90 days of treatment. There were no serious adverse events or evidence of complement activation.

At day 90, all participants had confirmed vector transduction and showed functional improvement on the NSAA scale and reduced creatine kinase (CK) levels. Participants demonstrated a mean increase of 5.5 points from baseline one year after treatment and 7.0 points from baseline two years after treatment. The NSAA is a validated scale developed to measure functional motor abilities in ambulant children with Duchenne, with scores ranging from 0-34.

As previously disclosed, micro-dystrophin protein levels for participants in Study 101 were as follows: 12-weeks post-infusion, a mean of 81.2% muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin with a mean intensity at the sarcolemma by immunohistochemistry of 96% compared to normal biopsies. Adjusted for fat and fibrotic tissue, western blot showed a mean expression of 95.8%.

About SRP-9001
SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver the micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein. Sarepta is responsible for global development and manufacturing for SRP-9001 and plans to commercialize SRP-9001 in the United States. In December 2019, the Company announced a licensing agreement granting Roche the exclusive right to launch and commercialize SRP-9001 outside the United States. Sarepta has exclusive rights to the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program initially developed at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, fatal neuromuscular genetic disease that occurs in approximately one in every 3,500-5,000 males worldwide. DMD is caused by a change or mutation in the gene that encodes instructions for dystrophin. Symptoms of DMD usually appear in infants and toddlers. Affected children may experience developmental delays such as difficulty in walking, climbing stairs or standing from a sitting position. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms, neck and other areas. Most patients require full-time use of a wheelchair in their early teens, and then progressively lose the ability to independently perform activities of daily living such as using the restroom, bathing and feeding. Eventually, increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure. The condition is universally fatal, and patients usually succumb to the disease in their twenties.

About Sarepta Therapeutics
At Sarepta, we are leading a revolution in precision genetic medicine and every day is an opportunity to change the lives of people living with rare disease. The Company has built an impressive position in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and in gene therapies for limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), and other CNS-related disorders, with more than 40 programs in various stages of development.

About Spinal Cord Injury
A spinal cord injury often causes permanent changes in motor function, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury.3 Cervical spinal cord injuries are the most common and debilitating, with many occurring in younger people, typically male adults, with 43 as the average age at the time of injury.4 A spinal cord injury after age 65 is most often caused by a fall.5 Signs and symptoms of spinal cord injuries include loss of movement; loss of sensation, including the ability to feel heat, cold and touch; loss of bowel or bladder control; exaggerated reflex activities or spasms; changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility; pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord; and difficulty breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from lungs.6

About Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations
Orphan Drug Designation is given to a drug or biologic for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a rare disease or condition.7 The FDA uses a fast track process to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.8

49313,Pfizer's Xeljanz (tofacitinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Active Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,U.S. FDA APPROVES PFIZER’S XELJANZ (TOFACITINIB) FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACTIVE POLYARTICULAR COURSE JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS,"The approval is based on P-III study including 2 phases assessing tofacitinib (5mg or 1mg/mL oral solution, bid) for 44wks. The 2phases includes an 18 wks. open-label, run-in phase study of 225 patients and a 26wks. PBO controlled withdrawal study of 173 patients
 Results: the study met its 1EP showing ACR30 response at the end of the run-in phase; the occurrence of disease flare in patients (31% vs 55%) @44wks. The approval makes Xeljanz the first and only JAK inhibitor approved in the US for pcJIA
 The US FDA has approved the two formulations of Xeljanz (a tablet and an oral solution) and are dosed based on weight. The oral solution is expected to be available by the end of Q1’21 while the tablets (5mg) are available instantly","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved XELJANZ® (tofacitinib) for the treatment of children and adolescents 2 years and older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA). Two formulations were approved, a tablet and an oral solution, and are dosed based upon weight.1 This approval makes XELJANZ the first and only Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pcJIA.

“Polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or pcJIA, is debilitating as it can cause significant jointpain and limit participation in child appropriate activities,” said Dr. Hermine Brunner, Director of the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and Scientific Director of the Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group. “Although there arealready several advanced treatments available, tofacitinib will be an appealing new option given it does not require injectionsor infusions. These can be quite burdensome to both children with pcJIA and their caretakers. The FDA approval of Xeljanz for pcJIA is positive news for this community as it provides a new advanced treatment option in an oral formulation.”2a,2b,3a,4a,5a,5b,5c

This approval was based on data from a Phase 3 study including two phases: an 18-week open-label, run-in phase (including 225 patients), followed by a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, withdrawal phase (including 173 patients) for a total duration of 44 weeks. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib taken as either a 5 mg tablet or as a 1 mg/mL oral solution twice daily based on the subject’s body weight (<40 kg for the oral solution) and/or patient preference.6a,6b The trial met its primary endpoint showing that in patients with pcJIA who achieved a juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response at the end of the run-in phase, the occurrence of disease flare in patients treated with tofacitinib (31 percent; n/N=27/88) was statistically significantly (p=0.0007) lower than patients treated with placebo (55 percent; n/N=47/85) at week 44.6c,6d In this study, disease flare was defined as a 30 percent or more worsening in at least three of the six variables of the JIA ACR core set, with no more than one of the remaining JIA core response variables improving by 30 percent or more (outcome measures used in JIA clinical trials) after randomization, 6e,7

In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with pcJIA were consistent with those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.Please see important safety information below.

“Many children and adolescents living with polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or pcJIA, are in need of advanced oral treatment options, so we are proud to now offer XELJANZ to this patient community,”4a said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This approval, which is the fourth indication for XELJANZ, reinforces its utility in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions and further demonstrates our expertise in JAK science.”

XELJANZ oral solution is anticipated to be available by the end of Q1 2021. XELJANZ 5 mg tablets are available immediately.

About Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. JIA includes six categories: systemic, oligoarticular, polyarticular, enthesitis-related, psoriatic, and undifferentiated. Polyarticular JIA is characterized by arthritis in five or more joints and affects both the small joints of the hands and feet, and large joints like the knees, hips and ankles.2a,2b,3a,8a JIA is defined as arthritis that begins before 16 years of age and persists for at least six weeks.8b While its cause is unknown, approximately 300,000 children in the U.S. have a form of JIA.9,4b

About XELJANZ® (tofacitinib)

XELJANZ® (tofacitinib) isapproved in the U.S. in four indications: adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after methotrexate failure, adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) failure, adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) after tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure, and patients 2 years of age or older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA). XELJANZ has been studied in more than 50 clinical trials worldwide, including more than 20 trials in RA patients, and prescribed to over 208,000 adult patients (the majority of whom were RA patients) worldwide in the last seven years. 10,11,12

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with XELJANZ* are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the infection is controlled.

Reported infections include:

• Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before XELJANZ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to XELJANZ use.

• Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.

• Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections, or with chronic or recurrent infection.

In the UC population, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily.

The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection, or those who have lived or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses. Viral reactivation including herpes virus and hepatitis B reactivation have been reported. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.

Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infection.

MORTALITY

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular (CV) risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day had a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden CV death, compared to those treated with XELJANZ 5 mg given twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing, postmarketing safety study. XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA. For UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response.

MALIGNANCIES

Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications.

Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a malignancy.

Malignancies (including solid cancers and lymphomas) were observed more often in patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily dosing in the UC long-term extension study.

Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS

Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. RA patients who were 50 years of age and older with at least one CV risk factor treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily compared to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or TNF blockers in a large, ongoing postmarketing safety study had an observed increase in incidence of these events. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death. Avoid XELJANZ in patients at risk. Discontinue XELJANZ and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis. For patients with UC, use XELJANZ at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response. XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA. In a long-term extension study in UC, four cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in XELJANZ clinical trials, although the role of JAK inhibition is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs).

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ and some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES

Lymphocyte Abnormalities: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean lymphocyte counts. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a count less than 500 cells/mm3. In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.

Neutropenia: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm3, interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm3. In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

Anemia: Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a hemoglobin level less than 9 g/dL. Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.

Liver Enzyme Elevations: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

Lipid Elevations: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. Manage patients with hyperlipidemia according to clinical guidelines. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.

VACCINATIONS

Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.

PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL NARROWING

Caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended release formulation.

HEPATIC and RENAL IMPAIRMENT

Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.

For patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg once daily.

For UC patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials in patients with RA with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and placebo, respectively, (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ with or without DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and hypertension. The safety profile observed in patients with active PsA treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA patients.

Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials for UC were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster.

USE IN PREGNANCY

Available data with XELJANZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and UC in pregnancy. In animal studies, tofacitinib at 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily demonstrated adverse embryo-fetal findings. The relevance of these findings to women of childbearing potential is uncertain. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.

49431,CSL Behring's Haegarda (C1 Esterase Inhibitor) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Pediatric Patients with Hereditary Angioedema,U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves HAEGARDA (C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous [Human]) for Prevention of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Attacks in Pediatric Patient,"The approval is based on P-lll COMPACT pivotal study and OLE study assessing Haegarda (C1 Esterase Inhibitor, SC) vs PBO in patients aged ≤17yrs. with symptomatic HAE. 
 Results of COMPACT pivotal study: 95% reduction in the number of HAE attacks, 99% reduction in the use of rescue medication. COMPACT OLE results: all patients experienced a>50% reduction in the number of attacks/ mos. with a 97% reduction in the median number of attacks/ mos. (0.11). All had less than 1 attack/4wks. period and four had >1attack/yr. (one subject was attack free) while no one discontinues the treatment due to AEs
 Haegarda is a self-administered, plasma-derived concentrate of C1-esterase inhibitor and the only SC therapy approved in the US for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attack in patients aged ≥6yrs.","KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., Sept. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — CSL Behring, a global biotherapeutics leader, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded indication for HAEGARDA® (C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous [Human]) for routine prophylaxis to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 6 years of age and older. A rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE affects about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States1, causing painful, potentially debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body.2 Children have a 50% chance of inheriting HAE if one of their parents has the disease.2  HAEGARDA, the HAE therapy that reduces attacks by a median of 95%, is now the first and only subcutaneous treatment option for prevention of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 6 years of age and older.  In addition to the expanded pediatric indication, the updated label now includes clinical safety data regarding HAEGARDA use in pregnant women.

“Since 2017, HAEGARDA has been a trusted and effective option for patients seeking to prevent HAE attacks, but until now preventative options for younger children living with the condition have been limited,” said Debra Bensen-Kennedy, MD, Vice President, North America Medical Affairs, CSL Behring. “With this expanded indication, we are able to offer pediatric patients as young as 6 years of age, an effective, preventative subcutaneous solution and deliver on our promise of addressing the unmet needs of people living with HAE.”

The latest FDA approval was based on results from two CSL Behring-sponsored COMPACT (Clinical Study for Optimal Management of Preventing Angioedema with Low-Volume Subcutaneous C1-Inhibitor Replacement Therapy) trials: COMPACT Pivotal Study and COMPACT Open Label Extension (OLE) Study. COMPACT, an international, prospective multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study, included six subjects aged 17 years or younger with symptomatic HAE. In the COMPACT pivotal study, HAEGARDA, at the FDA approved dose of 60 IU/kg, reduced the number of HAE attacks by a median of 95% relative to placebo. Use of rescue medication was reduced by a median of greater than 99% versus placebo.3 COMPACT OLE featured 126 subjects, including nine patients ages 17 years or younger.  In this trial, all nine pediatric subjects experienced greater than 50 percent reduction in number of attacks per month versus the pre-study period, with a median of 97% reduction in the median number of attacks/month (0.11).4 All subjects had less than one attack/4-week period and four had less than one attack/year (one subject was attack free).4,5 No subject discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related adverse event. Safety and effectiveness results of subgroup analysis by age was consistent with overall study results.

“The FDA’s approval of HAEGARDA for preventing HAE attacks in children six years of age and older represents a major stride in filling an unmet medical need.  The U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association is excited that there is now a subcutaneous prophylaxis option for the younger members of our HAE community and the families that care for them,” said Anthony J. Castaldo, U.S. HAEA President & Chief Executive Officer.

The new label now includes results from the randomized, open-label, active treatment controlled study regarding four patients who became pregnant during the study, and received treatment until pregnancy was identified. These patients ranged in age from 19 to 32 and received C1-INH (S.C. administration). Patients received HAEGARDA for 4 – 8 weeks (9 – 15 doses) during the first trimester.  As noted, these women reported no complications during delivery and all women delivered healthy babies.5, 6

“As the mother of a young patient and an active member of the HAE community, this news brings tears to my eyes as I am reminded of our struggles and strides over the years,” says Lisa Chacon, HAE patient advocate. “It warms my heart to know that so many children will now have access to this convenient, preventative therapy.”

CSL Behring is driven by its promise to save and improve the lives of HAE patients and their families and is committed to helping patients get access to its innovative therapies, regardless of their financial situation.

About HAEGARDA® (C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous [Human])
HAEGARDA is a self-administered, plasma-derived concentrate of C1-esterase inhibitor and the only subcutaneous therapy approved in the United States for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attack in patients 6 years of age and older. HAEGARDA targets the root cause of HAE by replacing deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, restoring functional C1-INH levels to above 40 percent of normal levels, which is proposed to reduce the risk of HAE attacks. HAEGARDA is dosed individually based on body weight so that each patient can achieve functional C1-INH levels.

About Hereditary Angioedema
A rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE causes painful, debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body. HAE is one of two forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, the other being nonhereditary or acquired angioedema. HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a key protein in the body that controls swelling. The defect with C1-INH lies within a person’s genetic code, which is why HAE runs in families. HAE is classified as either type I, type II or HAE with normal C1-INH levels.

About CSL Behring

INDICATIONS AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT HAEGARDA
INDICATIONS
HAEGARDA®, C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous (Human), is a plasma-derived concentrate of C1 Esterase Inhibitor (C1-INH) indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 6 years of age and older. HAEGARDA is for subcutaneous use after reconstitution only.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
HAEGARDA is contraindicated in patients with a history of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to C1-INH preparations or their excipients.

Severe hypersensitivity reactions to HAEGARDA could occur. In such cases, discontinue administration and institute appropriate treatment. Epinephrine should be immediately available to treat hypersensitivity reactions.

At the recommended subcutaneous dose of HAEGARDA, no causal relationship to thromboembolic events (TEs) has been established. However, TEs have been reported with intravenous administration of C1-INH products, usually at high doses.

In clinical trials, adverse reactions observed in more than 4% of subjects treated with HAEGARDA were injection-site reactions, hypersensitivity, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness.

HAEGARDA is derived from human plasma. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.

The new system has received CE mark in Apr’2020","Next-generation Valve Designed to Reduce Paravalvular Leaking, Improve Procedural Efficiency and Treat More Patients with Expanded Indication over Prior Version

MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Sept. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced it has initiated a controlled launch of the ACURATE neo2™ Aortic Valve System in Europe. This next-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) technology is a new platform designed with a number of features to improve upon the clinical performance of the original ACURATE neo platform. Compared to the previous generation device, the ACURATE neo2 valve system also has an expanded indication for patients with aortic stenosis – with no specified age or risk level – who are considered appropriate candidates for the therapy by their heart team, including a cardiac surgeon.

Indicated to restore function and normal blood flow through a severely narrowed aortic valve, the ACURATE neo2 Valve System features a new annular sealing technology designed to conform to irregular, calcified anatomies and further minimize paravalvular regurgitation or leaking (PVL). In addition, the delivery system simplifies access to smaller and complex vessels at the entry site and allows for highly accurate valve positioning while the top-down deployment mechanism further supports stable placement and release to ensure the best patient outcomes.

“We believe having this differentiated valve with the enhanced sealing technology will further drive favorable market experience and growth,” said Joe Fitzgerald, president, Interventional Cardiology, Boston Scientific. “Combined with the LOTUS Edge™ Aortic Valve System and SENTINEL™ Cerebral Protection System to protect the brain against the risk of TAVI-related stroke, the ACURATE neo2 valve represents the natural evolution of our complementary dual-valve TAVI toolkit that covers the needs of a wide range of patient cases.”

Data from the ACURATE neo2 CE-Mark Study demonstrated PVL rates for the ACURATE neo2 Valve System to be lower than previously reported with the current generation ACURATE neo valve. At 30 days and 1 year after implantation, respectively, 97% and 97.5% of patients experienced ≤ no/trace or mild PVL, 3.0% and 2.5% of patients experienced moderate PVL and 0% of patients experienced severe PVL.1,2

“We are pleased to bring the latest iteration of ACURATE technology to market, offering design improvements that further support procedural performance and optimal outcomes for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, from those with simple to the most challenging anatomies,” said Dr. Ian Meredith, AM, executive vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. “The straightforward implant procedure also enables physicians to reduce the length of time patients need to stay in the hospital, without compromising on safety and clinical results.”

The ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System received CE Mark in April 2020. In the U.S., the ACURATE neo2 Valve System is an investigational device being assessed in the ACURATE IDE clinical trial and is not available for sale.

About Aortic Valve Disease
Aortic valve disease results in dysfunction of the aortic valve, one of the four valves that control the flow of blood in and out of the heart. Aortic valve stenosis is the process of thickening and stiffening in the valve, which can result in an abnormal narrowing of the aortic valve opening and reduction in blood flow. Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the world, affecting approximately 7 percent of the population over age 65.3 From the onset of severe aortic stenosis symptoms, the average survival rate is 50 percent at two years and 20 percent at five years without aortic valve replacement.4,5

About INOVIO’s DNA Medicines Platform

INOVIO has 15 DNA medicine clinical programs currently in development focused on HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, including coronaviruses associated with MERS and COVID-19 diseases being developed under grants from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the U.S. Department of Defense. DNA medicines are composed of optimized DNA plasmids, which are small circles of double-stranded DNA that are synthesized or reorganized by a computer sequencing technology and designed to produce a specific immune response in the body.

INOVIO’s DNA medicines deliver optimized plasmids directly into cells intramuscularly or intradermally using INOVIO’s proprietary hand-held smart device called CELLECTRA®. The simple-to-use CELLECTRA device provides a brief electrical pulse to reversibly open small pores in the local skin area cells resulting in more than a hundred-fold increase in product delivery providing dose sparing and consistency. Once inside the cell, the DNA plasmids instruct the cell to produce the targeted antigen. The antigen is processed naturally in the cell and triggers specific T cell and antibody-mediated immune responses. Administration with the CELLECTRA device, which takes only a few seconds, is designed to ensure that the DNA medicine is efficiently delivered directly into the body’s cells, where it can go to work to drive the immune responses. INOVIO’s DNA medicines are transient, and do not interfere with or change in any way an individual’s own DNA. The advantages of INOVIO’s DNA medicine platform are how fast DNA medicines can be designed and manufactured; the stability of the products, which do not require freezing in storage and transport; and the consistent immune response, safety profile, and tolerability that have been observed in clinical trials with multiple products.

With more than 2,000 patients receiving INOVIO investigational DNA medicines in more than 7,000 applications across a range of clinical trials, INOVIO has a strong track record of rapidly generating DNA medicine candidates with potential to meet urgent global health needs.

Greatest improvements in patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response prior to treatment

Plan rapidly to discuss results with regulatory authorities

Regeneron to host investor and media webcast to discuss results at 4:30 pm ET today

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the first data from a descriptive analysis of a seamless Phase 1/2/3 trial of its investigational antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 showing it reduced viral load and the time to alleviate symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. REGN-COV2 also showed positive trends in reducing medical visits. The ongoing, randomized, double-blind trial measures the effect of adding REGN-COV2 to usual standard-of-care, compared to adding placebo to standard-of-care.

This trial is part of a larger program that also includes studies of REGN-COV2 for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and for prevention of infection in people who have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.

“After months of incredibly hard work by our talented team, we are extremely gratified to see that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 rapidly reduced viral load and associated symptoms in infected COVID-19 patients,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “The greatest treatment benefit was in patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response, suggesting that REGN-COV2 could provide a therapeutic substitute for the naturally-occurring immune response. These patients were less likely to clear the virus on their own, and were at greater risk for prolonged symptoms. We are highly encouraged by the robust and consistent nature of these initial data, as well as the emerging well-tolerated safety profile, and we have begun discussing our findings with regulatory authorities while continuing our ongoing trials. In addition to having positive implications for REGN-COV2 trials and those of other antibody therapies, these data also support the promise of vaccines targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.”

The descriptive analysis included the first 275 patients enrolled in the trial and was designed to evaluate anti-viral activity with REGN-COV2 and identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment; the next cohort, which could be used to rapidly and prospectively confirm these results, has already been enrolled. Patients in the trial were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a one-time infusion of 8 grams of REGN-COV2 (high dose), 2.4 grams of REGN-COV2 (low dose) or placebo. All patients entering the trial had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that was being treated in the outpatient setting. Patients were prospectively characterized prior to treatment by serology tests to see if they had already generated antiviral antibodies on their own and were classified as seronegative (no measurable antiviral antibodies) or seropositive (measurable antiviral antibodies). Approximately 45% of patients were seropositive, 41% were seronegative and 14% were categorized as “other” due to unclear or unknown serology status.

Key data findings include:
Note that since this analysis was considered descriptive, all p-values are nominal.

As hypothesized, patients in the study consisted of two different populations: those who had already mounted an effective immune response, and those whose immune response was not yet adequate. These populations could be identified serologically by the presence (seropositive) or absence (seronegative) of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and/or by high viral loads at baseline.
Serological status highly correlated with baseline viral load (p<0.0001). Seropositive patients had much lower levels of virus at baseline, and rapidly achieved viral loads approaching lowest levels quantifiable (LLQ), even without treatment. In contrast, seronegative patients had substantially higher viral levels at baseline, and cleared virus more slowly in the absence of treatment.
Serological status at baseline also predicted how rapidly patients had alleviation of their COVID-19 clinical symptoms. In the untreated (placebo) patients, seropositive patients had a median time to alleviation of symptoms of 7 days, compared to seronegative patients who had a median time to alleviation of symptoms of 13 days.
REGN-COV2 rapidly reduced viral load through Day 7 in seronegative patients (key virologic endpoint). The mean time-weighted-average change from baseline nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load through Day 7 in the seronegative group was a 0.60 log10 copies/mL greater reduction (p=0.03) in patients treated with high dose, and a 0.51 log10 copies/mL greater reduction (p=0.06) in patients treated with low dose, compared to placebo. In the overall population, there was a 0.51 log10 copies/mL greater reduction (p=0.0049) in patients treated with high dose, and a 0.23 log10 copies/mL greater reduction (p= 0.20) in patients treated with low dose, compared to placebo.
Patients with increasingly higher baseline viral levels had correspondingly greater reductions in viral load at Day 7 with REGN-COV2 treatment. The mean log10 copies/mL reduction in viral load compared to placebo were as follows:
–  Viral load higher than 105 copies/mL: high dose (-0.93); low dose (-0.86) (p=0.03 for both); approximately 50-60% reduction compared to placebo
–  Viral load higher than 106 copies/mL: high dose (-1.55); low dose (-1.65) (p<0.002 for both); approximately 95% reduction compared to placebo
–  Viral load higher than 107 copies/mL: high dose (-1.79); low dose (-2.00) (p<0.0015 for both); approximately 99% reduction compared to placebo
Patients who were seronegative and/or had higher baseline viral levels also had greater benefits in terms of symptom alleviation. Among seronegative patients, median time to symptom alleviation (defined as symptoms becoming mild or absent) was 13 days in placebo, 8 days in high dose (p=0.22), and 6 days in low dose (p=0.09). Patients with increasing viral loads at baseline had correspondingly increasing benefit in time to symptom alleviation.
There were a small number of medically-attended visits given that most non-hospitalized patients recover well at home. Patients in the seronegative group were at higher risk of medically-attended visits: 10 of the 12 medically-attended visits (defined as hospitalizations, or emergency room, urgent care or telemedicine visits for COVID-19) occurred in patients who were seronegative at baseline. In the seronegative group, 15.2% of placebo-treated patients, 7.7% of patients treated with high dose and 4.9% of patients treated with low dose required additional medical visits.
Both doses were well-tolerated. Infusion reactions were seen in 4 patients (2 on placebo and 2 on REGN-COV2). Serious adverse events occurred in 2 placebo patients, 1 low dose patient and no high dose patients. There were no deaths in the trial.
More than 2,000 people have been enrolled across the overall REGN-COV2 development program, and no unexpected safety findings have been reported by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.

“Thank you to the global investigators, sites and patients who continue to work with us to conduct REGN-COV2 trials, especially given the unique challenges posed by the pandemic,” said David Weinreich, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development at Regeneron. “We plan rapidly to submit detailed results from this analysis for publication in order to share insights with the public health and medical communities. Regeneron continues to enroll patients in this trial and all other ongoing late-stage trials evaluating REGN-COV2.”

Additional Trial Background
Among the first 275 patients, approximately 56% were Hispanic, 13% were African American and 64% had one or more underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19, including obesity (more than 40%). On average, patients were 44 years of age. In total, 49% of participants were male and 51% were female.

At least 1,300 patients will be recruited into the Phase 2/3 portion of the outpatient trial overall. Patients will be followed for 29 days, with viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract assessed approximately every 2-3 days in the Phase 2 portion of the trial and clinical endpoints assessed via investigator and patient-reported data throughout.

In addition to this trial in non-hospitalized patients, REGN-COV2 is currently being studied in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, the Phase 3 open-label RECOVERY trial of hospitalized patients in the UK and a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. Recruitment in all 4 trials is ongoing.

About REGN-COV2
REGN-COV2 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

To develop REGN-COV2, Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form REGN-COV2 bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in Science. Preclinical studies have shown that REGN-COV2 reduced the amount of virus and associated damage in the lungs of non-human primates.

REGN-COV2’s development and manufacturing has been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under OT number: HHSO100201700020C. Regeneron has recently partnered with Roche to increase the global supply of REGN-COV2. If REGN-COV2 proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Regeneron will manufacture and distribute it in the U.S. and Roche will develop, manufacture and distribute it outside the U.S.

49544,BMS's Reblozyl (luspatercept) Receives Health Canada Approval for Beta Thalassemia,"Health Canada Approves REBLOZYL (luspatercept), New Class of Treatment for Adult Patients Living with Beta Thalassemia","The approval is based on the P-lll BELIEVE study assessing Reblozyl (luspatercept) + BSC vs PBO + BSC in adult patients with anemia associated with beta-thalassemia requiring regular RBC transfusions
 Result: ≥33% reduction in RBC transfusion with a reduction of ≥2units from 13-24wks. (21.4% vs. 4.5%), results were published in NEJM
 Reblozyl regulate late-stage RBC maturation to potentially reduce the number of regular RBC transfusions and is the first and only erythroid maturation agent approved in Canada","REBLOZYL® is the first and only erythroid maturation agent approved for use in Canada

MONTREAL, Sept. 29, 2020 /CNW/ – Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) and Acceleron Pharma Inc. announced today that Health Canada has approved REBLOZYL® (luspatercept) for the treatment of adult patients with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent anemia associated with beta(β)-thalassemia.1 REBLOZYL® is the first and only erythroid maturation agent in Canada, representing a new class of treatment for eligible patients.1

Beta thalassemia is a rare genetic blood disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoeisis, which results in the production of fewer and less healthy RBCs and low levels of hemaglobin.2 Patients living with beta thalassemia are often required to receive regular red blood cell transfusions to support normal growth and development, maintain quality of life and increase life expectancy.2

“Canadians living with beta thalassemia, who are often dependent on regular blood transfusions, now have a new treatment option in REBLOZYL® that may address the underlying issues caused by this serious disorder and can decrease their dependence on blood transfusions,” said Riyad Elbard, President, Thalassemia Foundation of Canada.

REBLOZYL® works by regulating late-stage red blood cell maturation to potentially reduce the number of regular red blood cell transfusions.1 In preclinical studies, REBLOZYL® demonstrated the ability to address ineffective erythropoiesis by enhancing erythroid maturation, thereby increasing hemoglobin through the production of mature red blood cells.1

“As a first-in-class therapy, REBLOZYL® gives Canadians a new approach to treating transfusion dependent anemia associated with beta thalassemia,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “Regular red blood cell transfusions can cause abnormally high levels of iron in the blood and organs, potentially causing harm over time. The approval of REBLOZYL® is part of our commitment to Canadians living with serious blood disorders.”

“Alongside our partners at Bristol Myers Squibb, we are proud to help meet the needs of Canadians living with disease-related anemias,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “REBLOZYL® ultimately addresses the ineffective erythropoiesis associated with beta thalassemia and is an important advancement in the treatment of patients affected by this serious disorder.”

Health Canada’s approval of REBLOZYL® is based upon findings from the phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled BELIEVE study, which compared treatment with REBLOZYL® and best supportive care (BSC) to placebo and BSC in patients with anemia associated with beta-thalassemia requiring regular RBC transfusions.1 The results demonstrated significantly greater percentage of patients treated with REBLOZYL® achieving ≥33% reduction from baseline in RBC transfusion burden with a reduction of ≥2 units from Weeks 13-24 as compared to placebo (21.4% vs. 4.5%, P<0.001), primary endpoint.

The results of the BELIEVE trial were published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The results of the study showed that Toripalimab in combination with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) significantly extended the progression-free survival than the current standard treatment of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin. The Company will submit biologic license application (BLA) to the National Medical Products Administration (the “NMPA”) and regulatory authorities in other relevant countries in the near future.

About NPC
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a subtype of head and neck cancer, is a malignant tumor that occurs in the nasopharynx. According to statistics from the World Health Organization, NPC is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and the incidence in the region accounts for approximately 84.6% of the new cases worldwide. NPC is prone to distant metastasis at diagnosis, while early stage patients tend to relapse after radiation or radio-chemotherapy. Platinum-based therapy is currently standard care for recurrent or metastatic NPC. In addition, there is no standard treatment after failure of the first-line systemic chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with advanced disease is less than 10%.

The JUPITER-02 Study (NCT03581786) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multi-center Phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab versus placebo in combination with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin, as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Professor Xu Ruihua from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centre is the leading principal investigator. The JUPITER-02 Study enrolled a total of 289 patients. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety.

At the interim analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) determined that the global study met its primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS). Compared with the placebo control, Toripalimab in combination with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin significantly prolonged the PFS as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

49618,Medtronic to Acquire Avenu Medical,Medtronic to Acquire Avenu Medical,"Medtronic acquires Avenu Medical for its Percutaneous Fistula Creation Technology that will foster Medtronic’s peripheral vascular access portfolio and improves outcomes for patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis. The acquisition is expected to close in Oct’2020
 The acquisition allows Medtronic to bring less invasive, endovascular solutions to patients requiring durable vascular access. This marks the sixth acquisitions that Medtronic has made in 2020
 Avenu Medical’s Ellipsys Vascular Access system is a single-catheter, ultrasound-guided device that inserts a catheter percutaneously into the arm to create a durable AV fistula and has received CE Mark in the EU & is the US FDA approved","Avenu’s Percutaneous Fistula Creation Technology Will Strengthen the Medtronic Peripheral Vascular Access Portfolio and Reinforce Medtronic’s Commitment to Improving Outcomes for Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease

DUBLIN, Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced the planned acquisition of Avenu Medical, a privately held medical device company based in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. focused on the endovascular (minimally invasive) creation of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

AV fistulae are created by connecting a vein and artery in the arm to facilitate dialysis therapy. Historically, they have been created using an open surgical approach. In contrast, Avenu Medical’s Ellipsys® Vascular Access System is a single-catheter, ultrasound-guided device that inserts a catheter percutaneously (through the skin) into the arm to create a durable AV fistula. The procedure can be performed in the hospital outpatient department, ambulatory surgery center (ASC), or physician’s office.

“AV fistulae are like lifelines to patients undergoing dialysis. Until recently, the only option to create a fistula was through invasive surgery, which is associated with high failure rates,” said Jeffrey Hull, M.D., director of the Richmond Vascular Center and co-founder of Avenu Medical. “The Ellipsys system has shown durable outcomes out to two-years and has the ability to shorten procedure times and potentially reduce costs. Unlike open surgery, sutures are not required after the procedure and the patient leaves with just an adhesive bandage.”

The Ellipsys Vascular Access System bears the CE Mark for distribution in the European Union and is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is indicated in both geographies for the creation of a proximal radial artery to perforating vein anastomosis for percutaneous creation of an AV fistula.

“Medtronic’s acquisition of Avenu aligns directly with our vision of bringing less invasive, endovascular solutions to patients requiring durable vascular access,” said Mark Ritchart, president and chief executive officer of Avenu Medical. “With Medtronic’s extensive market presence, clinical leadership, and market development expertise, coupled with Avenu’s customer-focused team and innovative technology, we are confident that together, we can drive awareness and adoption of this technology globally.”

“Within the last year, we’ve seen significant momentum with the launch of the IN.PACT™ AV drug coated balloon (DCB) in the United States and primary endpoint results of the IN.PACT AV Access study being published in The New England Journal of Medicine,” said Mark Pacyna, vice president and general manager of the Peripheral Vascular business at Medtronic. “Now with the acquisition of Avenu Medical, we can support procedures across the vascular access care continuum, while continuing to provide innovative endovascular therapies that will ultimately reach even more patients with ESRD around the world.”

The acquisition is expected to close in October- subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The acquisition of Avenu Medical is the sixth in a series of tuck in acquisitions that Medtronic has made in 2020. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to Medtronic’s adjusted earnings per share in the first two fiscal years before turning accretive in fiscal year 2023. In addition, this transaction is expected to meet Medtronic’s long-term financial metrics for acquisitions.

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers, and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.

 Uptravi is a selective, prostacyclin IP receptor agonist, approved in IV formulation for PAH, WHO Group I in adults with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, who are currently prescribed oral Uptravi but are temporarily unable to take oral therapy","SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for UPTRAVI® (selexipag) as an injection for intravenous (IV) use for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adults with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, who are currently prescribed oral UPTRAVI but are temporarily unable to take oral therapy. In patients with PAH, interruptions in treatment should be avoided due to the progressive nature of the disease.1

UPTRAVI is a selective, prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. Oral UPTRAVI was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of PAH to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization.2

“Even relatively short-term PAH treatment interruptions due to a temporary inability to take oral medication, like during surgery, can have a significant negative impact on a person’s health,” said Neil Davie, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Pulmonary Hypertension, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We have demonstrated that continued treatment with UPTRAVI can significantly improve patients’ long-term outcomes. Preventing an interruption of treatment with an IV formulation is an important therapeutic option and we are pleased to be one step closer to bringing this important treatment to the PAH community.”

The NDA is based on the prospective, multi-center Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of patients with PAH temporarily switching from oral UPTRAVI to UPTRAVI IV, and then transitioning back to the initial oral dose. Results showed that UPTRAVI IV is suitable to maintain continuous dosing for short periods of time when oral administration of UPTRAVI is not feasible.1

About the UPTRAVI IV Study1

The UPTRAVI IV study (NCT03187678) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label single-sequence cross–over, Phase 3 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of temporarily switching between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV. The study examined a stable dose of UPTRAVI tablets to a corresponding dose of UPTRAVI for injection and switching back to UPTRAVI tablets. The treatment and observation phase was divided into 3 periods. In Period 1, patients received their stable oral dose of UPTRAVI twice daily (morning and evening of Day 1). In Period 2, patients received three infusions of corresponding UPTRAVI IV doses (morning and evening of Day 2, and morning of Day 3). In Period 3, patients resumed their stable oral UPTRAVI dose twice daily in the evening of Day 3 for 9 days, which was continued through the safety follow-up. Patients were hospitalized during Periods 1 and 2.

All 20 enrolled patients completed the study as planned and received all UPTRAVI doses (oral or IV). The switch between oral UPTRAVI and UPTRAVI IV was well tolerated, and there were no unexpected safety findings. Adverse reactions that resulted from UPTRAVI for injection were similar to those associated with UPTRAVI tablets, with the exception of infusion site reaction. Prostacyclin-associated adverse events included headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pain in jaw, myalgia, pain in extremity, flushing and arthralgia.1

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2

INDICATION

UPTRAVI® (selexipag) is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH.

Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms.

Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (29%), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (10%).

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil) with UPTRAVI is contraindicated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD)

Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue UPTRAVI.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions more frequent compared to placebo (≥3%) are headache (65% vs 32%), diarrhea (42% vs 18%), jaw pain (26% vs 6%), nausea (33% vs 18%), myalgia (16% vs 6%), vomiting (18% vs 9%), pain in extremity (17% vs 8%), flushing (12% vs 5%), arthralgia (11% vs 8%), anemia (8% vs 5%), decreased appetite (6% vs 3%), and rash (11% vs 8%).

These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase.

Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1% (n=8) of patients on UPTRAVI and in none of the patients on placebo.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP2C8 Inhibitors

Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, doubled exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant use of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 is contraindicated.

Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with clopidogrel, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2.7–fold. Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor.

CYP2C8 Inducers

Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes (rifampin) halved exposure to the active metabolite. Increase UPTRAVI dose, up to twice, when co-administered with rifampin. Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Recommended Dosage

Recommended starting dose is 200 mcg twice daily. Tolerability may be improved when taken with food. Increase by 200 mcg twice daily, usually at weekly intervals, to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice daily. If dose is not tolerated, reduce to the previous tolerated dose.

Patients With Hepatic Impairment

For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose is 200 mcg once daily. Increase by 200 mcg once daily at weekly intervals, as tolerated. Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).

Co-administration With Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors

When co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, deferasirox and teriflunomide), reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily. Revert back to twice daily dosing frequency of UPTRAVI when co-administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor is stopped.

Dosage Strengths

UPTRAVI tablet strengths:

200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 mcg.

Please see full Prescribing Information.

About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)

PAH is a specific form of PH that causes the walls of the pulmonary arteries (blood vessels leading from the right side of the heart to the lungs) to become thick and stiff, narrowing the space for blood to flow, and causing an increased blood pressure to develop within the lungs. PAH is a serious, progressive disease with a variety of etiologies and has a major impact on patients’ functioning as well as their physical, psychological and social wellbeing. There is currently no cure for PH and it is often fatal.3,4,5 However, the last decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH, transforming the prognosis for PAH patients from symptomatic improvements in exercise tolerance 10 years ago, to delayed disease progression today.

September 30, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today positive topline results from the ILLUMINATE-B pediatric Phase 3 study of lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) – the gene encoding glycolate oxidase (GO) – in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). ILLUMINATE-B is now the seventh Phase 3 study of an RNAi therapeutic that has yielded positive results, and the first-ever study evaluating the safety and efficacy of this new class of medicines in children under the age of six, including infants.

“We are pleased to report these positive topline results that we believe hold promise for many families impacted by PH1. The safety and efficacy of lumasiran are consistent with that reported for the ILLUMINATE-A study in patients six and older, demonstrating that lumasiran can significantly reduce the hepatic production of oxalate across all ages, which we believe can thereby address the underlying pathophysiology of PH1,” said Pritesh J. Gandhi, PharmD., Vice President and General Manager, Lumasiran Program at Alnylam. “The current standard of care for young children and infants diagnosed with PH1 is burdensome, including the frequent need for gastrostomy tube placement to enable hyperhydration, and, for those who have progressed to advanced disease, the risks associated with performing dialysis and, ultimately, organ transplantation. Thus, we believe, a meaningful reduction in urinary oxalate levels has the potential to favorably impact disease progression and management in very young patients. We look forward to reporting complete data from the ILLUMINATE-B study at the ASN virtual congress later this fall.”

“The ILLUMINATE-B results signal hope for the many families with children whose lives are deeply impacted by PH1. This is especially encouraging given that children as young as a few months old could benefit from the therapeutic approach that lumasiran offers, curbing production of oxalate at its source,” said Kim Hollander, Executive Director of the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation. “We are grateful to Alnylam for their continued commitment to the PH1 community and for designing and successfully conducting a study that addresses a particularly vulnerable group of patients – young children and babies.”

ILLUMINATE-B Topline Study Results

ILLUMINATE-B (NCT03905694) is a single arm, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 trial that enrolled 18 patients with PH1 under the age of six (range: 3-72 months), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of greater than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or normal serum creatinine if less than 12 months old, at nine study sites, in five countries around the world. Lumasiran was administered according to a weight-based dosing regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline to Month 6 in spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio averaged across Months 3 to 6. At six months, relative to baseline, lumasiran demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio. Reduction of urinary oxalate relative to baseline was consistent across all three body weight categories (less than 10 kg; 10 kg to less than 20 kg, and 20 kg or higher). Lumasiran demonstrated positive results across secondary endpoints, including additional measures of urinary and plasma oxalate. There were no serious or severe adverse events related to study drug, and the overall safety and tolerability profile of lumasiran was consistent with that observed in the ILLUMINATE-A study. Full ILLUMINATE-B study results will be presented on October 22, 2020 at the ASN virtual congress.

Lumasiran has received U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations, Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Alnylam has filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for lumasiran with the U.S. FDA. The FDA has granted a Priority Review for the NDA and has set an action date of December 3, 2020 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for lumasiran has been submitted to and validated by the EMA and has received Accelerated Assessment designation.

The Company is also conducting ILLUMINATE-C – a global single-arm Phase 3 study of lumasiran in PH1 patients of all ages with advanced renal disease, including patients on dialysis, with results expected in 2021.

About ILLUMINATE-A Phase 3 Study

ILLUMINATE-A (NCT03681184) is a six-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter Phase 3 study (with a 54-month extension period) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lumasiran in 39 patients with a documented diagnosis of PH1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three monthly doses of lumasiran or placebo followed by quarterly maintenance doses at 3 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was the percent change in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion from baseline to the average of months 3 to 6 in the patients treated with lumasiran as compared to placebo. Treatment arms were stratified at randomization based upon mean 24-hour urinary oxalate during screening (≤ 1.7 or > 1.7 mmol/24hr/1.73m2). Key secondary and exploratory endpoints were designed to evaluate additional measures of urinary oxalate, plasma oxalate, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), nephrocalcinosis, renal stone events, safety and tolerability.

About Lumasiran

Lumasiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). HAO1 encodes glycolate oxidase (GO). Thus, by silencing HAO1 and depleting the GO enzyme, lumasiran inhibits production of oxalate – the metabolite that directly contributes to the pathophysiology of PH1. Lumasiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. Lumasiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations, Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The safety and efficacy of lumasiran are under evaluation by the FDA and EMA.

About Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1)

PH1 is an ultra-rare disease in which excessive oxalate production results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. Current treatment options are very limited and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidney, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a small minority of patients respond to vitamin B6 therapy, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1.

About RNAi

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

At the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels, mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated in all age cohorts

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sep. 29, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced the publication of the second interim analysis of the open-label Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against COVID-19, in The New England Journal of Medicine. This interim analysis evaluated a two-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart in 40 healthy adult participants across two dose levels (25 and 100 µg) in two age cohorts (ages 56-70 and ages 71+), and reports results through Day 57 (1 month after the second dose). This analysis found that both the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels were generally well-tolerated in both age cohorts. Immune responses were dose-dependent with the 100 µg dose eliciting higher binding and neutralizing antibody titers, supporting the selection of the 100 µg dose for further study in the Phase 3 trial. The study was led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

“These interim Phase 1 data suggests that mRNA-1273, our vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19, can generate neutralizing antibodies in older and elderly adults at levels comparable to those in younger adults,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Moderna. “Given the increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in older and elderly adults, these data give us optimism in demonstrating mRNA-1273’s protection in this population, which is being evaluated in the Phase 3 COVE study.”

Both the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels of mRNA-1273 were generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported through Day 57. The most common solicited adverse events were headache, fatigue, myalgia, chills, and pain at the injection site, the majority of which were mild-to-moderate in severity and of self-limited duration. Local and systemic reactogenicity were more common and more frequently moderate in severity after the second dose. Two severe solicited systemic adverse events occurred following the second vaccination: fever in one participant in the ages 56-70 cohort who received the 25 µg dose and fatigue in one participant in the ages 71+ cohort who received the 100 µg dose. Clinical laboratory values of Grade 2 or higher revealed no pattern of concern. Participants will continue to be followed through 13-months to allow for a longer assessment of vaccine-related adverse events.

At both the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels, after two vaccinations, mRNA-1273 induced dose-dependent binding antibody responses reaching the upper quartile of the distribution of convalescent sera. At Day 57 (1 month post-dose 2), geometric mean titers (GMT) exceeded the median of those seen in convalescent sera from 41 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

Neutralizing activity was assessed with multiple assays, including a pseudovirus neutralization assay (pseudotyped lentivirus reporter single-round-of-infection neutralization assay [PsVNA]) against the two most common SARS-CoV-2 variants (614D and 614G) and three live-virus neutralization assays (SARS-CoV-2 nanoluciferase high-throughput neutralization assay [nLUC HTNA], focus reduction neutralization test mNeonGreen [FRNT-mNG] and classical plaque-reduction neutralization test [PRNT]). No participants had detectable neutralizing responses by any assay prior to vaccination, and robust neutralizing activity was observed in all participants 14 days after the second vaccination.

Pseudovirus neutralization responses were observed as early as seven days after the second vaccination and were dose-dependent across all age groups (18-55, 56-70 and 71+). At Day 43 at the 100 μg dose level, PsVNA ID50 titers in the older adult cohorts ages 56-70 (GMT 402) and 71+ (GMT 317) were comparable to those seen in the age 18-55 cohort (GMT 360), and 3- to 4-fold higher than those seen in convalescent sera (GMT 106). Titers remained high through four weeks after the second dose in all age cohorts. Neutralizing activity against the 614G variant was also observed at the 100 μg dose in all age cohorts.

Results were consistent using 3 live virus assays. Neutralizing antibody titers as measured by nLUC HTNA and FRNT-mNG were similar across all age groups (18-55, 56-70 and 71+). At Day 43, PRNT80 GMT in the 100 ug dose groups was 878 in the 56-70 and 317 in the 71+ age cohort, representing 5.5 and 2.0-fold above convalescent sera respectively, and 4.1-fold above convalescent sera in the 18-55 age group (GMT 654).

The 25 µg dose in the 56-70 age cohort and the 100 µg dose level across all age groups (18-55, 56-70 and 71+) elicited a strong Th1-biased CD4 T cell response.

The U.S. government has agreed to purchase 100 million doses of mRNA-1273, with an option to purchase an additional 400 million doses.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease’s (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. On May 12, the FDA granted mRNA-1273 Fast Track designation. On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: healthy adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrollment.

The Phase 3 COVE study of mRNA-1273, being conducted in collaboration with the NIH and BARDA, began on July 27. Results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating mRNA-1273 were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. A summary of the company’s work to date on COVID-19 can be found here.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is supporting the continued research and development of mRNA-1273 with $955 million in federal funding under Contract no. 75A50120C00034. BARDA is reimbursing Moderna for 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred by the company for conducting the program described in the BARDA contract. The U.S. government has committed up to $1.525 billion to purchase supply of mRNA-1273 under U.S. Department of Defense Contract No. W911QY-20-C-0100.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,900 participants, prior to enrolling the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

49733,Sobi & Selecta Report Results of SEL-212 in P-II COMPARE Study for Chronic Refractory Gout,Sobi and Selecta Biosciences announce topline data of SEL-212 from the phase 2 COMPARE study supporting the potential for important clinical improvement in patients with Chronic Refractory Gout,"The P-II COMPARE study assessing SEL-212 (once monthly) vs pegloticase (twice monthly) in 170 patients with chronic refractory gout
 SEL-212 showed a numerically higher response rate on 1EP during 3 & 6 mos., but didn’t meet 1EP of superiority, higher response rate during 3 & 6mos., an overall reduction in mean SUA levels; patients with tophi at baseline showed higher responder rates with a reduction in mean SUA and is well tolerated
 SEL-212 is a combination product candidate designed to sustain control SUA levels in patients with chronic refractory gout, potentially reducing harmful tissue urate deposits. The companies also initiate the P-III studies (DISSOLVE I& II) of SEL-212 for chronic refractory gout with its expected results in H2’22 and BLA filing in Q3’23","– All data consistent with stronger performance of SEL-212 versus pegloticase

– Numerically higher response rate for SEL-212 versus pegloticase during primary endpoint of months 3 and 6 combined; statistically significant higher response rate for SEL-212 versus pegloticase during month 3

– Statistically significant greater overall reduction in mean serum uric acid (SUA) levels in SEL-212 versus pegloticase

– Patients with tophi showed a substantially higher overall response rate for SEL-212 versus pegloticase and a statistically significant overall reduction in mean SUA levels for SEL-212 versus pegloticase

– Data demonstrate both SEL-212 and pegloticase were well-tolerated

– Data support commenced phase 3 DISSOLVE programme

STOCKHOLM and WATERTOWN, Mass., Sept. 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi™) (STO: SOBI) and Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: SELB), today announced topline data for the phase 2 COMPARE study comparing the efficacy of SEL-212, a combination of Selecta’s tolerogenic ImmTOR™ immune tolerance platform and a therapeutic uricase enzyme (pegadricase), to pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA®), the currently approved uricase in the US, for the treatment of chronic refractory gout.

Per FDA guidance on Statistical Considerations for Clinical Trials during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, the statistical analysis plan was modified and submitted to FDA prior to database lock to address the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the statistical analysis of the study endpoints. This was necessary due to increased protocol deviations in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population observed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Data are therefore presented per protocol (PP*) and ITT.

Topline results from the phase 2 COMPARE study are as follows:

SEL-212 showed a numerically higher response rate on the primary endpoint during months 3 and 6 combined, but did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical superiority: SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during months 3 and 6 combined: 59% SEL-212 versus 46% pegloticase, PP, p=0.056, 53% SEL-212 versus 46% pegloticase, ITT, p=0.181.
Statistically significant higher response rate of SEL-212 during month 3: SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during month 3: PP: 70% SEL-212 versus 51% pegloticase, p=0.019, ITT: 70% SEL-212 versus 54% pegloticase, p=0.017.
 Numerically higher response rate of SEL-212 during month 6: SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during month 6: PP: 61% SEL-212 versus 47% pegloticase, p=0.053, ITT: 54% SEL-212 versus 47% pegloticase, p=0.179.
Statistically significant greater overall reduction in mean SUA levels in SEL-212 versus pegloticase: Serum uric acid levels were reduced by an average of 6.68 mg/dL (computed by subtracting baseline SUA from mean SUA during the treatment period) for patients treated with SEL-212 versus 4.51 mg/dL for patients treated with pegloticase, p=0.003, during months 3 and 6 combined, PP; ITT: 6.79 mg/dL SEL-212 versus 4.85 mg/dL pegloticase, p=0.003.
In patients with tophi at baseline, substantially higher responder rates for SEL-212 compared to pegloticase on the primary endpoint, and statistically significant reduction in mean SUA: Approximately 41% of patients in the phase 2 COMPARE study had visible tophi at baseline. A greater differential on the primary endpoint between SEL-212 versus pegloticase on patients with tophi was observed: PP: 58% SEL-212 versus 39% pegloticase; ITT: 57% SEL-212 versus 41% pegloticase. In these patients, the mean SUA levels were reduced by an average of 7.42 mg/dL for patients treated with SEL-212 versus 4.64 mg/dL for patients treated with pegloticase, p=0.016, during months 3 and 6 combined, PP; ITT: 7.32 mg/dL for SEL-212 versus 4.89 mg/dL for pegloticase, p=0.019.
SEL-212 and pegloticase showed favorable safety results and were well-tolerated: There were no deaths during the study. There were no notable differences in serious Treatment Emergnet Adverse Events (TEAEs), treatment-related serious TEAEs, or infusion reactions between the two groups. A full analysis of safety signals, including gout flare incidence and severity, awaits evaluation of the full data set and will be reported together with the full efficacy analysis at a later medical meeting.
“There is a clear need for a next-generation treatment for chronic refractory gout, and the phase 2 COMPARE study demonstrated that SEL-212 led to a statistically significant reduction of serum uric acid levels versus standard of care in patients suffering from this painful, debilitating disease,” said Robert T. Keenan, MD, MBA, MPH, board certified rheumatologist at Duke University School of Medicine and Principal Investigator of the COMPARE study. “I believe that SEL-212 could meaningfully impact the lives of patients and provide a much-needed alternative in the treatment paradigm for patients with chronic refractory gout.”

“We believe SEL-212, if approved, could improve the lives of patients with chronic refractory gout, as data suggest that SEL-212 addresses several key unmet needs, including the potential to provide a persistent and significant reduction in SUA levels with a convenient monthly treatment,” said Carsten Brunn, Ph.D., President and CEO of Selecta. “The topline data from our COMPARE study demonstrate the promise of our ImmTOR platform to allow sustained therapeutic activity when combined with a highly immunogenic enzymatic therapy, such as our proprietary pegadricase. We look forward to evaluating SEL-212 in partnership with Sobi in our ongoing double blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 DISSOLVE programme and continuing to advance our ImmTOR platform in gene therapy.”

Guido Oelkers, Ph.D., President and CEO of Sobi, added, “SEL-212 is a highly differentiated product candidate for the treatment of chronic refractory gout, and these data reinforce our excitement about its potential. We are proud to collaborate with Selecta for the ongoing phase 3 programme which has already enrolled the first patient.”

SEL-212 has been licensed to Sobi, with Sobi undertaking development, regulatory and commercial activities in all markets outside of China. Sobi and Selecta recently announced the initiation of two double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical studies (DISSOLVE I and DISSOLVE II) of SEL-212 for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. Topline data from the DISSOLVE programme is expected in the second half of 2022, and a Biologics License Application (BLA) filing is expected in the first quarter of 2023.

About the phase 2 COMPARE study
The phase 2 COMPARE study evaluated 170 patients with chronic refractory gout, with 83 receiving an infusion of SEL-212 once monthly for six months and 87 receiving an infusion of pegloticase twice monthly for six months. The primary endpoint measure was a comparison of the percentage of patients on SEL-212 versus pegloticase who achieved and maintained a reduction of serum uric acid (SUA) < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during months three and six combined. Key secondary endpoint measures included a comparison of the percentage of patients on SEL-212 versus pegloticase who achieved and maintained a reduction of serum uric acid (SUA) < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during month 3 and during month 6, separately, and reduction of mean SUA assessed at the three- and six-month time points.

*The PP population is defined as patients who were administered any amount of study medication and have completed at least 65% of the study dosing visits unless early termination from the study occurred after study drug withdrawal due to meeting stopping rules or due to an adverse event, or due to investigator discretion and who have no major protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy assessments.

About SEL-212
SEL-212 is a novel combination product candidate designed to sustain control of serum uric acid (SUA) levels in patients with chronic refractory gout, potentially reducing harmful tissue urate deposits which when left untreated can lead to debilitating gout flares and joint deformity. SEL-212 consists of pegadricase, Selecta’s proprietary pegylated uricase, co-administered with ImmTOR, designed to mitigate the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADAs develop due to unwanted immune responses to biologic medicines, rendering these therapies less potent, which remains an issue across multiple therapeutic modalities and disease states including chronic refractory gout.

About Chronic Refractory Gout
Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis with more than 8.3 million patients in the United States having been diagnosed with gout, which is caused by high levels of uric acid in the body that accumulate around the joints and other tissues, and can result in flares that cause intense pain. Approximately 160,000 patients in the United States suffer from chronic refractory gout, a painful and debilitating condition in which patients are not able to get their SUA levels below 6 mg/dL and therefore have several flares per year and can develop nodular masses of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Elevated SUA levels have been associated with diseases of the heart, vascular system, metabolism, kidney and joints.

About Selecta Biosciences, Inc.
Selecta Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: SELB) is leveraging its clinically validated ImmTOR™ platform to develop tolerogenic therapies that selectively mitigate unwanted immune responses. With a proven ability to induce tolerance to highly immunogenic proteins, ImmTOR has the potential to amplify the efficacy of biologic therapies, including redosing of life-saving gene therapies, as well as restore the body’s natural self-tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The company’s first program aimed at addressing immunogenicity to AAV gene therapies is expected to enter clinical trials in early 2021 in partnership with AskBio for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a rare metabolic disorder. A wholly-owned program focused on addressing IgA nephropathy driven by ImmTOR and a therapeutic enzyme is also in development among additional product candidates. Selecta recently licensed its Phase 3 clinical program in chronic refractory gout to Sobi. For more information, please visit www.selectabio.com.

49747,"Henlius Reports First Patient Dosing with HLX11 (biosimilar, pertuzumab) for HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer and Early Breast Cancer",First patient dosed in phase 1 clinical trial of Henlius pertuzumab biosimilar HLX11,"The company has reported the first patient dosing in P-l study assessing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HLX11 vs US-, EU- and China-sourced reference pertuzumab in healthy Chinese male
 The 1EPs of the study is to compare the PK b/w HLX11 and the three different sourced reference drugs head-to-head while the 2EPs is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HLX11 and the reference drug, further describing the PK profile
 HLX11 can be potentially used for the treatment of HER2-positive mBC & eBC. Additionally, the study demonstrated that combining pertuzumab with trastuzumab and CT can decrease the risk of recurrence or death for HER2+ BC","Shanghai, China, September 20th, 2020-Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the first patient was dosed in China in a phase 1 clinical trial of the Company’s pertuzumab biosimilar HLX11, a recombinant anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subdomain II humanized monoclonal antibody injection.
HLX11 was independently developed by Henlius with the pertuzumab originator as reference drug and the development is in accordance with China’s biosimilar guidelines. HLX11 can be potentially used for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and early breast cancer. HER2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Proteins of this family can activate signal transduction pathways associated with cell growth and proliferation by forming homodimer or heterodimer, and the abnormal activation of these transduction pathways are proved to be correlated with tumorigenesis[1-2]. HER2 positive (HER2 protein overexpressing or her2 gene amplification) breast cancer takes up 20%-25% of all breast cancer cases and is a major subtype of breast cancer[3]. HLX11 can specifically bind with the subdomain II of HER2 extracellular domain and inhibit the herterodimerisation of HER2 and other HER family receptors, i.e. EGFR, HER2 and HER4. This will inhibit signal transduction of relevant pathways and lead to stop of growth and apoptosis of tumour cells. In the meantime, HLX11 can also enhance the tumour-killing activity of immune cells via antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity.
Clinical data demonstrated that combining pertuzumab with trastuzumab and chemotherapy can decrease the risk of recurrence or death for HER2 positive breast cancer patients[4-5]. In January 2020, the clinical trial application of HLX11 has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). HLX11 can be potentially used in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment for HER2 positive early breast cancer and in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic or unresectable locally recurrent breast cancer patients.
This phase 1 study is a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-controlled, four-arm trial aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of HLX11 with US-, EU- and China-sourced reference pertuzumab administrated intravenously in healthy Chinese male subjects. The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics between HLX11 and the three different sourced reference drugs head-to-head. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HLX11 and the reference drug and further describe their pharmacokinetic profiles. Results from this phase 1 study will provide reference for dosing scheme in the following clinical studies of HLX11.
Up to now, Henlius has a well-established product pipeline in the area of anti-HER2 treatment. Recently, the trastuzumab biosimilar 汉曲优®（HLX02, EU brand name: Zercepac®）, independently developed and manufactured by Henlius, has become the first domestic trastuzumab biosimilar approved in the EU and in China, providing a new standard treatment option for Chinese and European HER2 positive breast and gastric cancer patients. In addition, Henlius is also developing its innovative humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody HLX22, which has the potential to further improve treatment outcomes for HER2 positive breast cancer and gastric cancer patients. In the future, HLX11 can also be combined with 汉曲优® or HLX22, which will strengthen Henlius strategy of Global plus Combo. With the accumulated results and experience from extensive anti-HER2 researches, the Company has also built a solid foundation for the discovery and development of anti-HER2 bispecific/multi-target antibodies. In the future, Henlius will keep on innovating and strive for breakthroughs in the anti-HER2 area to bring more affordable and quality biologics to patients around the globe.

Different from currently approved bevacizumab biosimilars in China, the Phase 3 study of HLX04 was conducted among Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, which helps to accumulate more clinical evidence and experience of bevacizumab in this patient population. In addition, to explore the potential of VEGF inhibitors for ophthalmic diseases, Henlius is also developing HLX04 for the treatment of eye diseases including wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

The Phase 3 clinical study data also laid the foundation for the development of the immune combination therapy of HLX04 and Henlius’ anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody HLX10. Of note is that HLX04 plus HLX10 is the first domestic dual monoclonal antibody (mAb) combo therapy that has received Investigational New Drug Application approval from NMPA. This combination therapy is currently being developed for various solid tumours such as non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical development of this combination therapy in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients has entered pivotal Phase 3 stage.

Study design

HLX04-mCRC03 is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled Phase 3 study (NCT03511963) aimed to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HLX04 to reference bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX or mFOLFOX6) as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Enrolled patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either HLX04 or reference bevacizumab intravenously (7.5mg/kg every 3 weeks when combined with XELOX or 5mg/kg every 2 weeks when combined with mFOLFOX6). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at week 36 (PFSR36wk).

Results

Efficacy-Primary endpoint
675 patients were enrolled (HLX04, N=338; Reference bevacizumab, N=337). Per FAS, PFSR36wk was 46.4% in HLX04 group and 50.7% in reference bevacizumab group. The group difference was -4.2% (90% CI: -10.6%, 2.1%), which fell entirely in the pre-defined equivalence margins (-11%, 15%), demonstrating equivalent efficacy between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab.

Efficacy-Secondary endpoints
There was no statistically significant difference (p >0.05) between the treatment groups in secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DoR).

Safety and immunogenicity
The safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab.

Conclusion

The results of the Phase 3 study demonstrated the equivalence in efficacy between HLX04 and reference bevacizumab with similar safety and immunogenicity profiles as first-line treatment for mCRC patients. HLX04 will provide an alternative treatment option for cancer patients as a potential biosimilar candidate.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/henlius-4.jpg,Biosimilars,Henlius ,HLX-04 | Bevacizumab,metastatic colorectal cancer | biosimilars | bevacizumab|CSCO 2020|Data|Henlius|HLX04|P-III study|Released,publish,20/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/henlius-released-phase-3-study-data-of-its-bevacizumab-biosimilar-hlx04-at-csco-2020/,https://pharmashots.com/49759/henlius-presents-p-iii-data-of-hlx04-biosimilar-bevacizumab-at-csco-2020/

Title: Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Proposed Trastuzumab Biosimilar HLX02 Compared with Trastuzumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Global Phase 3 Study

Poster number: 287P

Form: E-poster

Presenter: Bing-He Xu, M.D., Ph.D.

Time: 09:00 (CEST) 17th Sept. 2020 – 20:00 (CEST) 21st Sept. 2020

Place: ESMO Congress platform (Online)

汉曲优Ⓡ (trastuzumab biosimilar, EU brand name: ZercepacⓇ) is developed by Henlius independently. The development process strictly followed the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) biosimilar guidelines, and 汉曲优Ⓡ has been approved by the NMPA and the European Commission (EC) recently, making it the first China-developed monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar to be approved both in China and in the EU. The HLX02 Phase 3 study (HLX02-BC01, NCT03084237 and EudraCT: 2016-000206-10) is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had not received prior systemic treatment to demonstrate equivalence in the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics between HLX02 and European Union (EU)-sourced trastuzumab (TZB). Professor Binghe Xu, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is the principle investigator of this study. Henlius has presented a part of sub-group analysis results of this HLX02 Phase 3 clinical trial at CSCO in 2019 and the Week 24 efficacy and safety results from different analysis sets at ESMO and ESMO Asia in 2019. Here, we reported the updated 1-year efficacy and safety results of the Phase 3 study and the PopPK model.

Study design

In the multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled HLX02-BC01 Phase 3 study (NCT03084237, EudraCT: 2016-000206-10), patients with HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior systemic treatment were randomised (1:1) to receive either HLX02 or European Union (EU) – sourced trastuzumab (TZB) in combination with docetaxel in a 3-week cycle for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was overall response rate after 8 treatment cycles at Week 24 (ORRwk24). The PopPK model was developed with the data from the HLX02-BC01 and HLX02-HV01 (NCT02581748) studies (HLX02, N=356; TZBs, N=398; Serum sample, N=5882) using non-linear mixed-effect modelling (NONMEMⓇ) with the first-order estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method. Important covariates (e.g. demographics, pathophysiologic and disease conditions) were included in model characterisation for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) correlation. A total of 1,000 simulations were tested using the observed covariates.

Results

Efficacy-Primary endpoint
649 patients were enrolled (HLX02, N=324; EU-TZB, N=325). Per ITT set, ORRwk24 was 71.3% in HLX02 group and 71.4% in EU-TZB group, and the group difference was -0.1% (95% CI: -7.0%, 6.9%). Per PP set, ORRwk24 was 74.2% in HLX02 group and 73.2% in EU-TZB group, and the group difference was 1.0% (95% CI: -6.0%, 7.9%).The group differences in ITT and PP sets both fell entirely in the pre-defined equivalence margins (±13.5%). All subgroup analyses (Asian vs. non-Asian, and Chinese vs. non-Chinese) showed no statistically significant differences (p >0.05) in ORR between the treatment groups in all populations, demonstrating the equivalence in efficacy.

Efficacy-Secondary endpoints
There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (p >0.05) in secondary endpoints, including clinical benefit rate (CBR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Safety
The safety profiles (including the incidence rate of drug related cardiac disorders) were similar between HLX02 and reference TZB.

PopPK
The PopPK model was described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. No statistically significant difference in steady state exposures (≤13% for AUCss and Cmax,ss) was observed between HLX02 and TZBs in the PopPK model. The influence of covariates (e.g. body weight) on PK exposure was similar between the HLX02 and TZBs treatment groups.

Conclusion

The results of the Phase 3 study and the PopPK model demonstrated the equivalent efficacy and similar safety and PK between HLX02 and reference TZB in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. HLX02, as the first approved China (CN) – manufactured TZB biosimilar, will be able to provide alternative treatment option for patients globally.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/henlius-5.jpg,Biosimilars,Henlius ,HLX-02 | Trastuzumab,metastatic breast cancer | biosimilars | ESMO|Henlius|HLX02|P-III Data|Present|trastuzumab,publish,17/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/the-updated-multi-centre-phase-3-clinical-study-data-of-trastuzumab-released-in-esmo/,https://pharmashots.com/49771/henlius-present-p-iii-data-of-hlx02-biosimilar-trastuzumab-at-esmo/

The Phase I/II clinical trial for the COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 has resumed in Japan after discussion with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

A standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials on 6 September to allow review of safety data by an independent committee. Their recommendations have been supported by international regulators in the UK, Brazil, South Africa, India and now in Japan, who have deemed that the trials are safe to resume.

AstraZeneca continues to work with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial. The safety of trial participants is of paramount importance and we are committed to upholding the highest standards of conduct in clinical trials.

AZD1222

AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

Aimovig Has the Longest Duration of Safety and Efficacy Trial Data for Any Anti-CGRP Pathway Therapy
 
Five-Year Open-label Extension Study Shows Patients Continued to Experience a Sustained Benefit; Aimovig Maintained a Consistent Safety Profile
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Oct. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that results reinforcing the long-term safety and efficacy profile of Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe) in patients with episodic migraine (EM) are being presented at the Migraine Trust Virtual Symposium. Results from the five-year, open-label treatment period of a Phase 2 study in episodic migraine prevention (NCT01952574) showed Aimovig helped patients achieve sustained reductions in monthly migraine days (MMD) and in use of acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM), such as triptans. Additionally, the safety profile was consistent with what was observed in the double-blind treatment phase of the study, with no increases in adverse event rates over five years of exposure.1

“These important data highlight the sustained efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of Aimovig, and provide crucial information for patients and doctors managing migraine,” said Dr. Messoud Ashina, professor of neurology in the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. “The study reinforces the potential of Aimovig to reduce monthly migraine days over the long term for people living with this debilitating, yet underdiagnosed disease. For my patients, more migraine-free days means they’re able to get back to the things that are important to them, like spending more time with family and friends, and being able to go to work.”1-4

The five-year, open-label treatment phase enrolled 383 patients with episodic migraine who completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (DBTP).1 Among the 216 patients who completed the open-label treatment phase, there was an average MMD reduction of 5.3 days from the DBTP baseline of 8.7 days.1 By the end of the study, patients who used AMSM to treat their migraine headaches experienced an average reduction in AMSM use of 4.4 days from the DBTP baseline of 6.2 days.1 The most common side effects were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and influenza.1

“Aimovig continues to have the longest safety and efficacy trial data among treatments for migraine in the calcitonin gene-related peptide class of medications,” said Darryl Sleep, M.D., senior vice president, Global Medical, and chief medical officer at Amgen. “Many people with this debilitating neurological disease live in dread of the next attack.3 As the first FDA-approved treatment and most prescribed preventive therapy in this class, Aimovig continues to be at the forefront of preventive migraine treatment and clinical research.5,6 These long-term results further demonstrate the potential of Aimovig to help the millions of patients who may be candidates for preventive treatment.”1,2,7,8 

Additional studies highlighting Aimovig will be presented at the Migraine Trust Virtual Symposium, including interim results of the LIBERTY open-label extension study, as well as efficacy and safety results of Aimovig in the EMPOwER study. These studies reinforce the safety and efficacy profile of Aimovig for patients of various backgrounds across the episodic migraine spectrum.

Interim two-year results of the open-label extension study of the LIBERTY study (NCT03096834) showed sustained efficacy and no increases in adverse events rates for patients with episodic migraine taking Aimovig who failed 2-4 prior preventive treatments.9
Results of the Phase 3 EMPOwER study (NCT03333109) highlighted the efficacy and safety of Aimovig in adult patients with episodic migraine from Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.10,11
About the Open Label Extension Phase of the Phase 2 Study in Episodic Migraine Prevention (NCT01952574)
After a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, 383 eligible adult patients with episodic migraine (defined in the trial as 4 to 14 migraine days and less than 15 headache days per month at baseline) were enrolled in the open-label treatment phase.1,12 All patients initially received 70 mg Aimovig monthly, with 250 patients increasing their dosage to 140 mg monthly after a protocol amendment to assess long-term safety of the higher dose.1,12,13 Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events, electrocardiograms, laboratory assessments, and vital signs.1

No new safety signals or increases in adverse event rates were observed over five years of exposure with Aimovig as compared to the DBTP, in which the safety and tolerability profiles of Aimovig were in line with other clinical trial data.1 The most common side effects were  nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and influenza.

About Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe)
Aimovig, co-marketed in the U.S. by Amgen and Novartis, is the first and only FDA and EMA-approved migraine preventive treatment that targets the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which is associated with migraine.5,14 Aimovig has been studied in several large, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its efficacy and safety in migraine prevention.15,16 Aimovig is self-administered once monthly via the easy-to-use SureClick® autoinjector, without a required loading dose.16 More than 3,000 patients participated in registrational trials of Aimovig across four placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies and their open-label extensions.1,9,10,15,16

Aimovig is also being evaluated through CATALYST, a comprehensive evidence generation program initiated by Amgen and Novartis that includes over 7,500 patients across 14 ongoing clinical trials and a robust assessment of real-world evidence. Spanning over 39 countries globally, CATALYST clinical trials will explore the role of Aimovig in comparative studies, assessing impact on novel migraine outcomes, understanding predictive biomarkers and expanding Aimovig’s use in additional study populations. To date, more than 440,000 patients across 44 countries worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.18

AIMOVIG INDICATION
Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe) is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Contraindication: Aimovig® is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to erenumab-aooe or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included anaphylaxis and angioedema.

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, have been reported with Aimovig® in post marketing experience. Most reactions were not serious and occurred within hours of administration, although some occurred more than one week after administration. If a serious or severe reaction occurs, discontinue Aimovig® and initiate appropriate therapy.

Constipation with Serious Complications: Constipation with serious complications has been reported following the use of Aimovig® in the postmarketing setting. There were cases that required hospitalization, including cases where surgery was necessary. The onset of constipation was reported after the first dose in a majority of these cases, but patients also reported later on in treatment. Aimovig® was discontinued in most reported cases. Constipation was one of the most common (up to 3%) adverse reactions reported in clinical studies.

Monitor patients treated with Aimovig® for severe constipation and manage as clinically appropriate. Concurrent use of medications associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for more severe constipation and the potential for constipation-related complications.

Hypertension: Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of Aimovig® in the postmarketing setting. Many of the patients had pre-existing hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring pharmacological treatment and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment but was most frequently reported within seven days of dose administration. In the majority of the cases, the onset or worsening of hypertension was reported after the first dose. Aimovig® was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

Monitor patients treated with Aimovig® for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of Aimovig® is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies (≥ 3% of Aimovig®-treated patients and more often than placebo) were injection site reactions and constipation.

Please see Aimovig® full Prescribing Information.

About Migraine
People with frequent migraine attacks may lose more than half their life to migraine.12 One attack could last up to three days.12 They endure debilitating pain, physical impairment, and live in constant dread of the next attack – all of which is compounded by a widespread misperception of the disease.3,19 The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study ranks migraine among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability worldwide.20 Migraine is associated with personal and societal burdens of pain, disability, and financial cost, and it remains under-recognized and under-treated.2,4

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

Any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

Nearly two-thirds of patients (65.6%) in STR1VE-EU have already achieved developmental motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1 at a mean duration of follow-up of 10.6 months, including patients with a more severe phenotype compared to previous studies
Two-thirds of patients (66.7%) were free of feeding support, an important indicator of stabilization/halting of disease progression
New interim Phase 3 STR1VE-EU data presented at WMS support the robust clinical evidence that have demonstrated a consistent, transformative benefit across Zolgensma clinical trials for the treatment of patients with SMA
More than 600 patients now treated with Zolgensma, including some more than five years post-treatment and more than five years old
Basel, October 1, 2020 – Novartis Gene Therapies today announced new interim data from the ongoing Phase 3 STR1VE-EU clinical trial for Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) that demonstrated patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 continued to experience significant therapeutic benefit, including event-free survival, rapid and sustained improvement in motor function and motor milestone achievement, including for some patients with more aggressive disease at baseline compared to previous trials. SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene that results in the progressive and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing, and basic movement.1,2,3 These data as of December 31, 2019, and presented today during a virtual Clinical Trial Poster Session as part of the World Muscle Society (WMS) 2020 Virtual Congress, support the robust clinical evidence that has demonstrated a consistent, transformative benefit across Zolgensma clinical trials for the treatment of patients with SMA.

“We are seeing further evidence of the potential of Zolgensma to effectively halt motor neuron loss following a one-time, intravenous infusion. In STR1VE-EU, patients achieved rapid improvements in motor function following treatment with Zolgensma, and most have already achieved motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1,” said Professor Eugenio Mercuri, M.D., PhD., Department of Pediatric Neurology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. “These interim results are especially encouraging considering STR1VE-EU includes some patients with a more severe phenotype than in the START and STR1VE-US studies, further supporting the gene therapy’s positive benefit/risk profile, even in this more fragile population.”

“These strong interim results from the STR1VE-EU clinical trial continue to demonstrate consistent and significant therapeutic benefit in patients with SMA Type 1, the most common form of the disease, adding to the robust body of clinical evidence for Zolgensma,” said Shephard Mpofu, M.D., SVP, Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Gene Therapies. “With more than 600 patients now treated, including some more than five years post-treatment and more than five years old, these data further reinforce the transformative benefit a one-time dose of Zolgensma has on SMA patients.”

Phase 3 STR1VE-EU Data as of December 31, 2019
STR1VE-EU is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single, one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in patients with SMA Type 1 who are less than six months of age at the time of gene therapy, with one or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene and who have bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations. The mean age of dosing was 4.1 months and the mean age at the onset of symptoms was 1.6 months. The mean Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) score at baseline was 28. Thirty-one of 33 patients (93.9%) were able to swallow thin liquids, and 10 patients (30.3%) required feeding support at baseline. Nine of thirty patients (27.3%) required ventilatory support at baseline. STR1VE-EU is distinct in its inclusion and exclusion criteria and baseline clinical characteristics of enrolled patients compared with START or STR1VE-US. Specifically, some patients in STR1VE-EU had a more severe disease phenotype at baseline, including lower CHOP-INTEND scores and the need for nutritional and ventilatory support.

At last visit before the data cutoff, patients in STR1VE-EU were between 6.9 and 18.6 months of age, and mean duration in the study was 10.6 (1.8–15.4) months. Thirty-one out of 32 (97%) patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population survived event-free, including 30 (93.8%) who could have reached 10.5 months of age and 18 (56.3%) who could have reached 13.6 months of age. An event is defined as the need for tracheostomy or the requirement of ≥16 hours of respiratory assistance per day (via non-invasive ventilatory support) for ≥14 consecutive days in the absence of an acute reversible illness, excluding peri-operative ventilation. Untreated natural history indicates that only 50% and 25% of babies with SMA Type 1 will survive event-free by the time they reach 10.5 months of age and 13.6 months of age, respectively.3

Twenty-one patients (65.6%) achieved motor milestones not observed in the natural history of SMA Type 1. This includes six patients (18.8%) who could sit independently for ≥10 seconds (the primary efficacy endpoint), 20 patients (66.7%) who gained head control, eight patients (25%) who were able to roll from back to sides and one patient who could stand with assistance, crawl and walk with assistance. The mean increase in CHOP INTEND from baseline was 5.9 points (n=31) which was observed as early as at one month post-dosing, 10.1 points at 3 months (n=29) post-dosing, and 13.3 points at six months (n=27) post-dosing. Twenty-one children (65.6%) enrolled in STR1VE-EU achieved and maintained a CHOP INTEND score of ≥40 points and 12 children (37.5%) were able to achieve a score of ≥50. According to natural history, untreated patients with SMA Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP INTEND score ≥40.3,4

The majority (91.7%) of patients who were free of ventilatory support at baseline remained either completely free of ventilatory support or received prophylactic BiPAP support during the study for acute reasons. Two-thirds (66.7%) of patients in the ITT population were able to feed orally without the need for feeding support, an important indicator of stabilization/halting of disease progression.

As previously reported, one patient discontinued the study because of a serious adverse event of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and respiratory distress that resulted in death. Novartis and the investigator considered the events and death to be unrelated to treatment with Zolgensma based on autopsy findings. Thirty-two of 33 patients were reported to have at least one adverse event (AE), of which six patients experienced serious adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to Zolgensma. Liver transaminase elevations, some of which were reported as adverse events, were experienced by 29 of 33 patients (87.9%), but all resolved with the use of prednisolone. Four patients had reported decreases in platelet counts <75,000, three of which were isolated laboratory abnormalities without adverse events reported. Overall, no new safety signals have been identified and the reported adverse events are consistent with the cumulative safety profile with Zolgensma.

Novartis Gene Therapies is grateful to the courageous patients and families who participate in clinical trials, enabling the company to further its efforts to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with rare genetic diseases.

About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)
Zolgensma® is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2019 and represents the first approved therapeutic in Novartis Gene Therapies’ proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy.5 In addition to the United States, Zolgensma is approved in Japan, Europe and Brazil. More than 600 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. Novartis Gene Therapies is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Israel, Australia, and South Korea in late-2020 or early 2021.5

Novartis Gene Therapies has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AAV9 gene therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; has an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Généthon for in vivo delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA; and a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death.1,2 If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.3,4
SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.1 It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.5 This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.6 More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.7

49827,AstraZeneca's Farxiga Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Chronic Kidney Disease,Designation follows DAPA-CKD Phase III trial results in which Farxiga demonstrated unprecedented reduction in the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular or renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease,"The BT destination follows P-lll DAPA-CKD assessing Farxiga (10mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO in 4,304 patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with/ out T2D across 21 countries
 Results: 39% reduction in the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of CV or renal death; 31% reduction in death from any cause
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monothx. and combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control, weight loss, and BP reduction","AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the US for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D).

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function and is often associated with an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.1,2,3 In the US, 37 million people are estimated to have CKD.1

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging early clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.4

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “There is a serious, unmet need for better and earlier treatment options for patients with chronic kidney disease. Following the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD results, the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is further testament to Farxiga’s potential to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. We look forward to working with the FDA to make Farxiga available to patients as quickly as possible.”

The FDA granted BTD based on clinical evidence from the DAPA-CKD trial. The detailed results presented in August demonstrated that Farxiga on top of standard of care reduced the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of cardiovascular (CV) or renal death by 39% compared to placebo (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 5.3%, p<0.0001) in patients with CKD while also significantly reducing death from any cause by 31% (ARR = 2.1%, p=0.0035) compared to placebo.5

In the US, Farxiga is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D and to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in patients with T2D and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. In May, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hHF in adults with heart failure (HF) (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D.

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months) affecting nearly 700 million people worldwide, many of them still undiagnosed.3,6-8 The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis. 9 CKD is associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of CV events,3 such as HF and premature death.2 In its most severe form, known as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.1 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.10

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2-4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga is given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause). The secondary endpoints included the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause. The trial was conducted in 21 countries and detailed results were announced in August 2020.

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hHF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

Farxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials. Farxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

Press Release
STADA is submitting approval applications to launch the new therapy in major European markets. Approvals are already in place in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.
By acquiring Lobsor Pharmaceuticals, STADA gains rights to a triple fixed combination (levodopa, carbidopa, entacapone), delivered via modern pump technology, that has already been successfully launched in Nordic countries.
STADA CEO Peter Goldschmidt: “This acquisition of Lobsor significantly expands STADA’s specialty footprint and serves as further evidence that STADA is a leading go-to-partner for specialty pharmaceuticals, generics and consumer health products. It also complements our portfolio and expertise in the treatment of late-stage Parkinson’s disease, where we have strong expertise via our company Britannia Pharmaceuticals.“
 

Bad Vilbel, Germany. October 2, 2020 – STADA Arzneimittel has strengthened its footprint in specialty pharmaceuticals by acquiring an innovative therapy used for treating late-stage Parkinson’s disease. The infusion of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone is already approved in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, and STADA is currently submitting approval applications to launch the therapy in a number of major European markets.

German-headquartered STADA is increasingly adding differentiated specialty pharmaceuticals to its existing strengths in generics and non-prescription consumer health products. This vision has been further realised through the acquisition of global commercial rights, outside the Americas, Japan and Taiwan, in return for undisclosed payments to Lobsor’s owners. STADA is committed to its vision of bringing advanced Parkinson’s disease treatments to a therapeutic category in which it already has extensive experience.

STADA’s Britannia, with its focus on neurology and central nervous system indications, already offers apomorphine hydrochloride injection and infusion treatments. The deal also reflects STADA’s ongoing commitment to supplying patient-focused value-added medicines, including in central nervous system indications.

“This acquisition of Lobsor significantly expands STADA’s specialty footprint and serves as further evidence that STADA is a leading go-to-partner for specialty pharmaceuticals, generics and consumer health products,” commented STADA CEO Peter Goldschmidt. “It also complements our portfolio and expertise in the treatment of late-stage Parkinson’s disease, where we have strong expertise via our company Britannia Pharmaceuticals.”

Sweden-based Lobsor Pharmaceuticals already holds marketing authorisations for the levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone patented gel formulation, enabling it to supply patients in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. STADA has already sought regulatory approval via Europe’s mutual recognition process in several key European countries and anticipates making further filings in the near future.

Lobsor Pharmaceuticals CEO Ulf Rosén stated: “With limited resources, we have managed to take the treatment system through proof of concept and early proof of business. Now it is time to scale up, and Britannia has the relevant experience, organisation, resources and out-reach to make the therapy available internationally.” He continued: “Lobsor’s management is happy to stay on to support a smooth and effective transition and is looking forward with anticipation to handing over the treatment system to Britannia.”

The levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone infusion therapy is inserted into the small intestine through a discreet, lightweight and wearable pump. The pump is currently prescribed for patients with late-stage Parkinson’s disease who are experiencing debilitating motor symptoms that can no longer be controlled by oral medication.

Dominic Graham, Operations Director at the European Parkinson’s Disease Association, the leading voice for PD associations around Europe, commented: “Very often people with Parkinson’s experience significant uncertainty because their condition can rapidly switch between being able to move and being immobile. Infusion pump treatments provide invaluable flexibility for individuals, as well as an opportunity to help plan and have better control over their daily lives.”

“Parkinson’s disease patients and their clinical teams have an urgent need for next-generation therapies that can improve lives, such as by increasing therapy adherence or reducing side effects,” stated Dag Nyholm, Associate Professor of Neurology at Uppsala University, Sweden. “Continuous improvement of the management of Parkinson’s disease, including through infusion pump therapies and deep-brain stimulation, is important. The field is moving forward in several areas; with exciting new approaches which try to modify the course of the disease. However, we have to keep improving the symptomatic treatments which our patients the best possible quality of life, in spite of the degenerative nature of the disease,” he added.

Robert Wood, Managing Director of Britannia, commented: “We believe this infusion formulation will have positive clinical benefits for patients who need a device-aided, continuous form of therapy which can resolve intractable motor fluctuations and improve their quality of life. We aim to broaden patient access to a device that is light, user-friendly, and discreet, enabling them to get on with their everyday lives with the full support of Britannia’s existing 24-hour Parkinson’s disease nurse service.”

Mavacamten Will Be a Medium- and Long-Term Growth Driver Presenting a Significant Commercial Opportunity upon Approval

Promising Portfolio of Pipeline Candidates Strengthens and Extends Bristol Myers Squibb’s Leading Cardiovascular Franchise

Expected to be Accretive to Non-GAAP Earnings Starting in 2023

NEW YORK & BRISBANE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYOK) today announced a definitive merger agreement under which Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire MyoKardia for $13.1 billion, or $225.00 per share in cash. The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Bristol Myers Squibb and MyoKardia Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2020.

MyoKardia is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing targeted therapies for the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases. Through the transaction, Bristol Myers Squibb gains mavacamten, a potential first-in-class cardiovascular medicine for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (“HCM”), a chronic heart disease with high morbidity and patient impact. A New Drug Application (“NDA”) for mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM – based on data from the EXPLORER-HCM study – is expected to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the first quarter of 2021. Bristol Myers Squibb expects to explore the full potential of mavacamten in additional indications, including non-obstructive HCM, as well as develop MyoKardia’s promising pipeline of novel compounds, including two clinical-stage therapeutics: danicamtiv (formerly MYK-491) and MYK-224.

“The acquisition of MyoKardia further strengthens our portfolio, pipeline and scientific capabilities, and is expected to add a meaningful medium- and long-term growth driver,” said Giovanni Caforio, M.D., Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are further strengthening our outstanding cardiovascular franchise through the addition of mavacamten, a promising medicine with the potential to address a significant unmet medical need in patients with cardiovascular disease. Our companies share a commitment to innovation and bold science, and our respective strengths will help us realize the value inherent in this portfolio. We have long admired MyoKardia and what they have done to revolutionize cardiovascular treatments through a precision medicine approach. We look forward to welcoming their talented team to our company.”

“MyoKardia was formed eight years ago with the aim of changing the world for people with serious cardiovascular diseases through bold and innovative science. Since then, MyoKardia’s dedicated employees have established an unparalleled pipeline of targeted therapeutics designed to change the course of disease and return the heart to normal function,” said Tassos Gianakakos, Chief Executive Officer of MyoKardia. “Bristol Myers Squibb shares our vision for transforming the treatment of cardiovascular disease. They value our team and the potential of our platform and, most importantly, share our unwavering commitment to placing patients at the center of everything we do. Together, our complementary strengths and expanded resources and reach will further accelerate the pace at which we can discover, develop and commercialize our novel medicines for the benefit of people suffering from cardiovascular disease around the world.”

Compelling Benefits

Bristol Myers Squibb expects the transaction, when complete, to:

Further strengthen the company’s outlook with the addition of mavacamten, which has significant commercial potential in the lead indication, obstructive HCM, and upside in additional future indications, including non-obstructive HCM .
With the high unmet medical need in obstructive HCM, mavacamten can be a significant medium- and long-term growth driver. Mavacamten demonstrated clinically meaningful results in the pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trial, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, and showed meaningful improvements in symptoms, functional status and quality of life by reducing the obstruction of blood flow from the heart. This potential first-in-class medicine, for which an NDA is expected to be submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021, may help to change the course of the disease.
Accelerate the expansion of Bristol Myers Squibb’s cardiovascular portfolio.
Bristol Myers Squibb has established Eliquis® (apixaban) as the #1 oral anticoagulant globally with a best-in-class profile, driven by leading commercial execution.Mavacamten will be a fully owned asset that fits well into Bristol Myers Squibb’s existing portfolio, given the company’s broad expertise in cardiovascular disease. Through this acquisition, Bristol Myers Squibb gains MyoKardia’s critical talent and capabilities on the U.S. West Coast, which will support fully realizing the opportunity in obstructive HCM and exploring the full potential of mavacamten in additional indications. Bristol Myers Squibb will also be well positioned to advance the global development of MyoKardia’s portfolio of clinical- and early-stage pipeline candidates, while continuing to advance its existing Factor XIa inhibitor program.
Deliver significant financial benefits.
The transaction is expected to add a significant growth driver during the medium- to long-term. It is expected to be minimally dilutive to Bristol Myers Squibb’s non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) in 2021 and 2022 and accretive beginning in 2023. Bristol Myers Squibb reaffirms its existing 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. There is no reliable estimable comparable GAAP measure as described below.
Transaction Terms and Financing

Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of MyoKardia’s common stock for $225.00 per share in cash. MyoKardia’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that MyoKardia shareholders tender their shares in the tender offer.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of MyoKardia’s common stock and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Following the successful closing of the tender offer, Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire all remaining shares of MyoKardia that are not tendered into the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price of $225.00 per share.

Bristol Myers Squibb expects to finance the acquisition with a combination of cash and debt.

About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is a chronic, progressive disease in which excessive contraction of the heart muscle and reduced ability of the left ventricle to fill can lead to the development of debilitating symptoms and cardiac dysfunction. HCM is estimated to affect one in every 500 people.

The most frequent cause of HCM is mutations in the heart muscle proteins of the sarcomere. In approximately two-thirds of HCM patients, the path followed by blood exiting the heart, known as the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), becomes obstructed by the enlarged and diseased muscle, restricting the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body (obstructive HCM). In other patients, the thickened heart muscle does not block the LVOT, and their disease is driven by diastolic impairment due to the enlarged and stiffened heart muscle (non-obstructive HCM). In either obstructive or non-obstructive HCM patients, exertion can result in fatigue or shortness of breath, interfering with a patient’s ability to participate in activities of daily living. HCM has also been associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.

There are currently approximately 160,000 to 200,000 people diagnosed with symptomatic obstructive HCM across the U.S. and EU, with no existing effective treatment options beyond limited symptomatic relief.Patients are typically diagnosed in their 40s or 50s and the treatment is expected to be chronic. It is estimated that only approximately 25 percent of individuals with obstructive HCM and only approximately 10 percent of individuals with non-obstructive HCM have received a diagnosis.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Financial Guidance

This release contains non-GAAP financial guidance, which is adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These non-GAAP items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of the company’s baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of the company’s underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information are indications of the company’s baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of the company’s ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators that we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. There is no reliable or reasonably estimable comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP financial guidance because we are not able to reliably predict the impact of specified items beyond 2020. As a result, reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.

NVIDIA will invest ~ $51.7M in Cambridge-1","SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — GTC — NVIDIA today announced that it is building the United Kingdom’s most powerful supercomputer, which it will make available to U.K. healthcare researchers using AI to solve pressing medical challenges, including those presented by COVID-19.

Expected to come online by year end, the “Cambridge-1” supercomputer will be an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ system capable of delivering more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance, which would rank it No. 29 on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. It will also rank among the world’s top 3 most energy-efficient supercomputers on the current Green500 list.

Among the first pharmaceutical companies to harness Cambridge-1 for research will be GSK and AstraZeneca. Additionally, researchers from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies plan to take advantage of the system.

“Tackling the world’s most pressing challenges in healthcare requires massively powerful computing resources to harness the capabilities of AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, in his GPU Technology Conference keynote. “The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the U.K., and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation’s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.”

NVIDIA has previously announced that it intends to create an AI Center of Excellence in Cambridge, featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer, which will serve as a hub of collaboration for AI researchers, scientists and startups across the U.K. As these plans develop, Cambridge-1 will become a part of that Center of Excellence, which will expand to include further supercomputers, and support more industries across the U.K.

Four Key Focus Areas
The system’s mission is to support and further enable the U.K. ecosystem of healthcare and life science researchers, which has become an epicenter for transformative healthcare research and discovery. Its four key focus areas will be:

Joint industry research — Solving large-scale healthcare and data-science problems which otherwise could not be tackled due to their size, resulting in improved patient outcomes, increased success rates and decreased overall healthcare costs.
University-granted compute time — Access to NVIDIA GPU time will be donated as a resource to specific studies to contribute to the hunt for cures.
Support AI startups — NVIDIA will provide opportunities to learn — and it will collaborate with startups to nurture the next generation and provide early access to AI tools.
Educate future AI practitioners — The system will serve as a destination for world-class researchers and provide hands-on experiences to the next generation.
Cambridge-1 AI
Cambridge-1 will be the first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access. Powered by 80 NVIDIA DGX A100™ systems connected by NVIDIA Mellanox® InfiniBand networking, it will give researchers and academics the ability to tackle some of the most challenging AI training, inference and data science workloads at scale. While traditional supercomputers can take years to deploy, the modular DGX SuperPOD architecture enables the system to be installed and operational in as little as a few weeks. NVIDIA will invest around £40 million ($51.7 million) in Cambridge-1.

NVIDIA Clara for Computational Drug Discovery
NVIDIA will help researchers take advantage of NVIDIA Clara Discovery™, a state-of-the-art suite of tools optimized for NVIDIA DGX™ that brings together the power of imaging, radiology and genomics to develop AI applications for the biggest computational tasks of healthcare.

It features pre-trained AI models and application-specific frameworks to help researchers define the next generation of drug discovery processes, from finding targets to building compounds to developing responses.

Using a recent breakthrough in natural language processing, researchers can now leverage biomedical-specific language models to organize, understand and activate large datasets, research literature and sort through papers or patents on existing treatments and other important real-world data.

Supercharging Healthcare Research with UK’s Leaders
Top pharmaceutical companies, tech startups and members of academia and research plan to use Cambridge-1 for solo and joint projects that expand the boundaries of science — pushing for better patient care, diagnosis and delivery of critical medicines and vaccines around the world.

Each has a vision for modern healthcare with AI driving wider leaps in existing protocols and practices:

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK: “AI and machine learning are like a new microscope that will help scientists to see things that they couldn’t see otherwise. NVIDIA’s investment in computing, combined with the power of deep learning, will enable solutions to some of the life sciences industry’s greatest challenges and help us continue to deliver transformational medicines and vaccines to patients. Together with GSK’s new AI lab in London, I am delighted that these advanced technologies will now be available to help the U.K.’s outstanding scientists.”

James Weatherall, Ph.D., Head of Data Science and AI, AstraZeneca: “The use of big data, supercomputing and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform research and development; from target identification through clinical research and all the way to the launch of new medicines.”

Sebastien Ourselin, Head, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King’s College London: “Recent advances in AI have seen increasingly powerful models being used for complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language understanding. These models have achieved previously unimaginable performance by using an unprecedented scale of computational power, amassing millions of GPU hours per model. Through this partnership, for the first time, such a scale of computational power will be available to healthcare research — it will be truly transformational for patient health and treatment pathways.”

Dr. Ian Abbs, Chief Executive and Chief Medical Officer of Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust: “If AI is to be deployed at scale for patient care, then accuracy, robustness and safety are of paramount importance. We need to ensure AI researchers have access to the largest and most comprehensive datasets that the NHS has to offer, our clinical expertise, and the required computational infrastructure to make sense of the data. This approach is not only necessary, but also the only ethical way to deliver AI in healthcare — more advanced AI means better care for our patients.”

Gordon Sanghera, CEO, Oxford Nanopore Technologies: “Compact AI has enabled real-time sequencing in the palm of your hand, and AI supercomputers are enabling new scientific discoveries in large-scale genomic datasets. These complementary innovations in data analysis support a wealth of impactful science in the U.K. and, critically, support our goal of bringing genomic analysis to anyone, anywhere.”

49864,Novartis Reports Results of Beovu (brolucizumab) in Two New Post-Hoc Analyses of P-III HAWK and HARRIER Studies for Wet AMD,New Phase III analysis demonstrates Novartis Beovu showed improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in wet AMD patients with early persistent fluid,"The P-III HAWK (6/3mg) & HARRIER (6mg) study assessing Beovu [q12w/q8w with the majority on q12w following the loading phase) vs aflibercept (2mg) in 1,800 patients with wet AMD across 400 centers
 Results: first analysis ewer patients had early persistent fluid (12.5% vs 20.4%), defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid or subretinal fluid through @12wks. treatment, patients gain greater BVCA (6.4 vs.3.7), CST control (80% vs 69%) respectively, presented at EURETINA
  Beovu is the first advanced humanized scFv, approved for clinical use in 40+ countries, including in the US, EU, UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia","Oct 05, 2020
In a post-hoc analysis of HAWK and HARRIER, fewer Beovu (brolucizumab) patients had early persistent fluid (12.5% vs. 20.4% of aflibercept patients), defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid and/or sub-retinal fluid through week 12 of treatment1
Patients with early persistent fluid treated with Beovu experienced greater gains in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 96 versus patients treated with aflibercept (6.4 vs. 3.7 letters, respectively)1
This data, along with nine additional analyses of HAWK and HARRIER presented at EURETINA 2020 virtual congress, further support Beovu as an efficacious treatment option for wet AMD
Basel, October 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that results of two new post-hoc analyses of the Phase III HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were presented at the EURETINA 2020 virtual congress. The first analysis demonstrated fewer Beovu® (brolucizumab) patients had early persistent fluid, defined as the presence of intra-retinal fluid and/or sub-retinal fluid through week 12 of treatment, compared with aflibercept patients1. For patients who did have early persistent fluid, those treated with Beovu achieved greater best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gains and greater reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) at week 96 versus those treated with aflibercept1.

A second analysis showed Beovu was associated with better control of retinal fluid, as measured by achievement and maintenance of defined CST levels. In the study, more Beovu patients than aflibercept patients achieved CST control (80% vs. 69% at week 96 at a defined CST threshold of 320 µm, respectively)2. Patients who stayed longer in a controlled CST state had better visual gains compared with those who remained in an uncontrolled CST state2. CST is a key indicator of fluid in the retina, and drying the retina is a core aim of treatment for wet AMD2.

“The data presented at EURETINA suggests Beovu can better help patients who have persistent retinal fluid achieve disease control by reducing CST and improving their vision in the long term,” said Dirk Sauer, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology. “These results further strengthen our confidence in Beovu as an effective and important treatment option for wet AMD patients aiming to improve their vision.”

Novartis has nine podium presentations at the congress and is sponsoring a Beovu symposium and an independent medical education program conducted by EURETINA.

New Phase III analysis demonstrates Novartis Beovu® showed improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in wet AMD patients with early persistent fluid

About Beovu (brolucizumab)
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is the first advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) approved for clinical use3-5. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics5-7.

The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms6. Beovu is engineered to deliver a high concentration of drug, thus providing more active binding agents3-5. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction6-8. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema9. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability9.

Beovu is approved in more than 40 countries, including in the US10, EU11, UK11, Japan12, Canada13 and Australia14, based on the results of the HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials.

About the HAWK and HARRIER studies
With more than 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide, HAWK (NCT02307682) and HARRIER (NCT02434328) are the first global head-to-head trials in patients with wet AMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy of Beovu at week 48 using an innovative q12w/q8w regimen, with a majority of patients on q12w immediately following the loading phase3,4. Both studies are 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies and part of the Phase III clinical development of Beovu3,4. The studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD3,4. The most common adverse events (≥5% of patients) with Beovu were vision blurred, cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous floaters and eye pain3,4.

STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer, today announced that the company has entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to evaluate SpringWorks Therapeutics’ investigational gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), nirogacestat, in combination with Pfizer’s anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3 bispecific antibody, PF‐06863135, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Gamma secretase inhibition prevents the cleavage and shedding of BCMA from the surface of myeloma cells. In preclinical models, nirogacestat has been shown to increase the cell surface density of BCMA and reduce levels of soluble BCMA, thereby enhancing the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies, including CD3 bispecific antibodies.

“This collaboration is another important step in continuing to advance our goal of developing nirogacestat as a best-in-class BCMA potentiator, and we are pleased to work with Pfizer to study nirogacestat in combination with PF‐06863135, which has recently demonstrated promising monotherapy clinical data,” said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks Therapeutics. “We now have five collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities. We look forward to generating clinical data with our collaborators to further evaluate the ability of nirogacestat to improve outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will sponsor and conduct the Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and will assume all costs associated with the study, other than expenses related to the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. Pfizer and SpringWorks Therapeutics will also form a joint development committee to manage the clinical study, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021.

“Entering into this clinical collaboration is a proud milestone in our strong relationship with SpringWorks,” said Chris Boshoff, MD, PhD, Chief Development Officer for Pfizer Oncology at Pfizer. “We believe that studying nirogacestat in combination with PF-06863135 could hold significant therapeutic promise for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and we look forward to working together to advance this important area of research.”

In addition to its ongoing clinical collaborations with BCMA-directed therapies, SpringWorks is also currently conducting a global Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the DeFi Trial) to evaluate nirogacestat in adults with progressing desmoid tumors.

About Nirogacestat
Nirogacestat is an investigational, oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development for desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft-tissue tumors. Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to desmoid tumor growth.

In addition, gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is evaluating nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator and has five collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities, including with an antibody-drug conjugate, two CAR T cell therapies and two bispecific antibodies. In addition, SpringWorks and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have entered into a sponsored research agreement to further characterize the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA directed therapies using a variety of preclinical and patient-derived multiple myeloma models developed by researchers at Fred Hutch.

Nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of desmoid tumors (June 2018) and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (September 2019). The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis (November 2018 and August 2019).

 Result: ORR is consistent with previously reported P-I study while other measures of efficacy including DoR are promising and 50%+ of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date whereas safety & tolerability is similar to previous P-I data
 Detailed results of the P-II study will be submitted to the IASLC 2020 World Congress on Lung Cancer while the company has begun recruiting in P-III CodeBreaK 200 study evaluating Sotorasib vs docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC patients","Durable Anticancer Activity Observed in Patients Whose Cancer Had Progressed Despite Prior Treatment With Chemotherapy and/or Immunotherapy

Safety and Tolerability Similar to Previously Reported Phase 1 Results in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Oct. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced positive topline Phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib (proposed INN for AMG 510) in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had failed a median of two prior lines of anti-cancer therapies (immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

Sotorasib demonstrated an objective response rate (primary end point) consistent with previously reported Phase 1 data in patients with advanced NSCLC taking the 960 mg daily dose. Other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, were promising and more than half of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date. Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported data in Phase 1 in patients with advanced NSCLC.

“Targeting KRAS has been a 40-year quest that has left patients with limited options. These topline data underscore our belief in the potential for sotorasib to become the standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer patients with the KRAS G12C mutation who remain in need of new treatment options,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We now have more than 500 patients who have been enrolled across clinical studies, and we are rapidly moving forward with a broad-based development program, which includes monotherapy studies in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and other solid tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation, as well as a suite of combination studies.  We look forward to discussing the current results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies, to determine the best path forward for sotorasib as a potential treatment for patients with NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation.”

Detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase 2 clinical study in patients with advanced NSCLC will be submitted to the IASLC 2020 World Congress on Lung Cancer taking place January 2021. A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC patients (CodeBreaK 200) has begun recruiting.

About KRAS
The RAS gene family, which has been the subject of almost four decades of research, contains some of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers.1,2 Targeting the KRAS protein, the most commonly altered family member in solid tumors, has been one of the toughest challenges in cancer research.1 A specific mutation known as KRAS G12C, is a major driver of tumor growth, occurring broadly across solid tumor indications. In the U.S., about 13% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.3,4 It is also found in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers and 1-2% of numerous other solid tumors, making this among the most broadly represented mutations across cancer patient subgroups.5,6,7,8,9. With the discovery of a unique surface groove in the KRASG12C protein, Amgen developed and advanced the first investigational KRASG12C inhibitor into the clinic and is exploring the potential of KRASG12C inhibition across multiple tumor types for patients who remain in dire need of treatment options.1,10

About CodeBreaK
The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen’s investigational drug sotorasib is designed to treat patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. As the most advanced KRAS G12C clinical development program, CodeBreaK has enrolled more than 500 patients across 13 tumor types since its inception.

CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors. Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The study enrolled 126 patients, 123 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.

Amgen’s single-arm Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) (also part of CodeBreaK 100) is fully enrolled and topline results are expected in 2021. A global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC patients (CodeBreaK 200) has begun recruiting. Amgen is also enrolling several Phase 1b combination studies across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101).

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2  or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

 Zejula (PO, qc) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and has received approval in 2019, in Canada for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer","MISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 5, 2020 /CNW/ – ZEJULA (niraparib) is now approved in Canada for the monotherapy maintenance treatment of female adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapyi.

“Tragically, thousands of women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Canada this year, and about 2,000 are expected to die,” said Dr. Alex Romanovschi, Country Medical Director, GSK Canada. “ZEJULA represents a significant step forward as GSK is accelerating its oncology pipeline to deliver the next generation of medicines to Canadian patients. As part of GSK’s renewed focus on oncology, we’re proud that ZEJULA is now approved for first-line maintenance therapy, helping address the needs of Canadians living with these cancers earlier.”

Ovarian cancer

Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwideii. In Canada, it is the 5th most common cancer in women, and the most fatal gynecological canceriii. Ovarian cancer is most frequently diagnosed in women aged 55 to 64 years. It is estimated that this year 3,100 Canadian women will be newly diagnosed with this disease, and 1,950 will dieiv.

Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at later stages and follows a highly recurrent disease course with a 5-year survival rate of 29% for patients with advanced diseasev. Despite surgical cytoreduction and response to front-line platinum-based chemotherapy, up to 85% of women with advanced ovarian cancer experience cancer disease recurrence, at which point their disease is considered incurablevi. Maintenance treatments following response to chemotherapy aim to extend the benefit of chemotherapy by delaying time to recurrence and prolonging progression-free survival. As first-line treatment represents a key junction in the management pathway, maintenance therapy in this setting represents an opportunity to improve progression-free survival and maximize cancer remission.

About ZEJULA (niraparib)

ZEJULA is an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The approval of ZEJULA in the first-line setting was based on the results of the phase III PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012), which enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer following a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status.

In 2019, ZEJULA received approval in Canada for the maintenance treatment of female adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

multilang-release
Santhera will hold a conference call today at 13:00 CEST, 12:00 BST, 07:00 EDT. Details are at the end of this statement.

Pratteln, Switzerland, October 6, 2020 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces the discontinuation of its Phase 3 SIDEROS study with Puldysa® (idebenone) in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are in respiratory decline and receive concomitant glucocorticoid treatment. Data from an interim analysis conducted by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) concluded that the study was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint. As a consequence, Santhera will discontinue the study, withdraw the European marketing authorization application and end the global development program for Puldysa. The Company intends to initiate a restructuring plan for the business with a focus on retaining key functions for bringing DMD drug candidate vamorolone to patients and execute on its other pipeline programs.

Based on the now completed interim analysis which tested for efficacy, the DSMB has recommended the SIDEROS study be discontinued due to futility. The interim analysis was based on the primary endpoint of the study, the change of forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC%p) from baseline to 18 months of treatment. The outcome revealed that the probability of reaching the primary endpoint at the end of the study is too small to merit the continuation of the study. There were no safety concerns noted by the DSMB.

Santhera will stop the SIDEROS trial (including extension) and participants who are enrolled in the study will discontinue study medication and complete the study’s follow-up evaluations. Furthermore, following up on the recommendation from the DSMB, Santhera will discuss the impact of ending the SIDEROS study on ongoing expanded access programs with the corresponding regulatory bodies.

“We would like to thank the patients and the families, as well as investigators and medical professionals, who participated in the SIDEROS study. Without their contributions we would not be able to advance DMD research,” said Dario Eklund, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera. “While this is obviously not the outcome we expected, all our efforts in DMD will now be focused on progressing the promising drug candidate vamorolone which we recently licensed from ReveraGen to its next inflection point, the readout of 6-month topline data from the pivotal VISION-DMD study planned for the second quarter of 2021.”

In connection with this decision, Santhera intends to start a restructuring process, aligning its operations to focus on progressing vamorolone for DMD, lonodelestat for cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases and its discovery-stage gene therapy approach for congenital muscular dystrophy.

Conference Call
Santhera will host a conference call today at 13:00 CEST / 12:00 BST / 07:00 EDT. Dario Eklund, CEO of Santhera, will discuss this update. Participants are invited to call one of the following numbers 10-15 minutes before the conference call starts (no dial-in code is required):

HILDEN, Germany & GERMANTOWN, Md.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced plans to launch a novel straightforward approach to viral RNA epidemiology that will significantly simplify and accelerate PCR analysis and remove key testing bottlenecks for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.

QIAGEN’s innovative QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM Kit combines a liquid-based sample preparation step completed in only two minutes with real-time PCR detection in a streamlined workflow that can be automated with standard lab equipment for any throughput, any assay and any reaction need from single to multiplex testing. The kit, which uses the most common transport media such as Universal Transport Media (UTMTM) as the starting material, includes both sample extraction components and optimized PCR reagents for only one procedure.

The streamlined workflow takes under one hour to deliver a result, compared to approximately three hours for standard extraction-based quantitative PCR processes and can handle up to 2,600 samples per eight-hour shift per cycler. As a result, labs can significantly accelerate the time to result and the frequency of viral testing. With only three small pipette tips needed per sample, the kit keeps plastic usage to a minimum, while providing significant cost savings by reducing reagent use and labor utilization.

Initial studies run by select public health research institutions have shown that the level of detection of the new QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM Kit, when used with their assay, is similar to or better than regular PCR workflows, and that performance compares to standard public health protocols of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and others that use the gold standard for sample extraction.

MALVERN, Pa. & SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: PHAS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases, today announced that it has expanded its pivotal Phase 3 REVERSE-IT trial for its lead product candidate bentracimab (formerly PB2452) into Canada, where the first patients outside of the United States have now been enrolled and dosed. Bentracimab is a novel, human monoclonal antibody fragment that in earlier trials has shown immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of Brilinta® (ticagrelor).

“Brilinta is the best-in-class antiplatelet drug for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), recent stent placement, or a history of myocardial infarction. Like all antiplatelet therapies, it does create some challenges for patients with serious bleeding events or who need urgent surgery,” said John Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of PhaseBio. “In these situations, doctors need an intervention that immediately and sustainably reverses the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor; this is something that currently does not exist. Bentracimab has the potential to be an important solution as it provides immediate and sustained restoration of platelet function, with potential utility across a broad spectrum of bleeding events, urgent surgeries and invasive procedures.”

“With cardiovascular disease representing a leading cause of death in Canada, as in the rest of the world, we expect to continue to see widespread utilization of P2Y12 inhibitors like ticagrelor to help prevent adverse cardiovascular events in vulnerable patients. While ticagrelor is highly efficacious it poses increased risk of serious bleeding, like other P2Y12 inhibitors. The promise of a potential reversal agent addresses a significant unmet clinical need for a large number of patients at risk of severe bleeding or those who may suffer a serious bleeding episode while on ticagrelor,” said Subodh Verma, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiac surgeon and Professor at the University of Toronto, and a member of the REVERSE-IT steering committee and Canadian national lead investigator. “I am delighted that about 20 sites in Canada will participate in this important and potentially practice-changing clinical trial,” said Professor Verma.

“We have seen in prior trials that bentracimab provided immediate restoration of platelet function and believe that it can help ticagrelor patients receive the urgent care they need in cases of acute bleeding or in need of an urgent procedure,” said Dr. C. David Mazer, a Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Toronto and Canadian investigator on REVERSE-IT. Dr. Mazer continued, “We are delighted to be the first Canadian REVERSE-IT site to participate in the development of this critical therapy for patients in need.”

Jonathan Mow, Chief Executive Officer of PhaseBio added: “With a generic version of Brilinta under regulatory review in Canada and a best-in-class efficacy profile relative to other P2Y12 inhibitors, we anticipate significant growth in market share for ticagrelor in Canada and a growing need for a novel reversal agent like bentracimab. We view the expansion of REVERSE-IT enrollment into Canada as an important milestone for the global bentracimab program.”

Bentracimab has been studied in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit through immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor, potentially mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risks associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs. Additionally, in a translational study, bentracimab achieved equivalent reversal of branded ticagrelor and multiple ticagrelor generics. AstraZeneca reported net sales of $845 million for Brilinta in the first half of 2020, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year’s global total and an increase of 34% in emerging markets.

The Phase 3 clinical study is called REVERSE-IT (Rapid and SustainEd ReVERSal of TicagrElor – Intervention Trial). REVERSE-IT is a multi-center, open-label, prospective single-arm trial designed to study reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with bentracimab in patients who present with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or who require urgent surgery or invasive procedure. Approximately 200 patients are being targeted to be enrolled from major health centers worldwide. Patients with reported use of ticagrelor within the prior 3 days who require urgent ticagrelor reversal will be eligible for enrollment.

More information about the REVERSE-IT Phase 3 trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov, using the identifier NCT04286438.

About Bentracimab (PB2452)

Bentracimab is a novel, recombinant, human monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, bentracimab demonstrated the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit through immediate and sustained reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risks associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs. The Phase 1 clinical trial of bentracimab in healthy volunteers was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2019. In April 2019, bentracimab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation may be granted by the FDA when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapy. In September 2019, PhaseBio completed a Phase 2a trial in which bentracimab was investigated in older and elderly subjects on dual antiplatelet therapy of ticagrelor and low-dose aspirin. Additionally, the Phase 2a trial investigated a bentracimab regimen for the reversal of supratherapeutic doses of ticagrelor in healthy younger subjects. In both arms of the trial, bentracimab achieved immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor and was generally well-tolerated, with only minor adverse events reported. These results are consistent with the results observed in healthy younger subjects treated with ticagrelor in the previously published Phase 1 trial. PhaseBio initiated the REVERSE-IT trial, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of bentracimab, in March 2020 to support a Biologics License Application for bentracimab in both major bleeding and urgent surgery indications. There are currently no approved reversal agents for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs.

It is currently being evaluated in an ongoing P-III study with ~37,000 participants enrolled and 28,000 having received their second vaccination at >120 clinical sites worldwide including the US, Brazil, South Africa, and Argentina","NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, October 6, 2020 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for BNT162b2, the lead candidate from the companies’ vaccine development program against COVID-19. The EMA’s decision to start a rolling review follows the encouraging preliminary results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies in adults, which suggest that BNT162b2 triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies and TH-1 dominant CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that target SARS-CoV-2. A combination of an antibody and T cell response is believed to be important in eliciting protection against viral infection and disease. BioNTech and Pfizer plan to work with the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to complete the rolling review process to facilitate the final Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).

As part of the rolling review, the CHMP has begun evaluating data generated in pre-clinical trials. The formal MAA submission could be finalized following the rolling review process, pending demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety and confirmation from the EMA that the submitted data are adequate. The vaccine candidate will remain subject to the EMA’s diligent standards for quality, safety and efficacy.

“It is our duty to ensure that while we are working to develop a potential vaccine at unprecedented speed to help address this pandemic, we do so with the highest ethical standards while adhering to sound scientific principles. We will continue to have regular and open dialogue with the EMA throughout the rolling review process,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

“A global crisis the magnitude of COVID-19 has completely transformed the vaccine development and review process,” said Peter Honig, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Worldwide Safety and Regulatory of Pfizer. “We are making every effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies and are proud to take this historic step with the European Medicines Agency for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2.”

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. It encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is a target of virus neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 study ongoing at more than 120 clinical sites worldwide including the United States, Brazil, South Africa and Argentina. To date, the trial has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants with more than 28,000 having received their second vaccination.

Preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 portions of the study have demonstrated that BNT162b2 was well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events in all age groups. The vaccine candidate generated dose level-dependent immunogenicity, as measured by receptor binding domain (RBD)-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. In addition, BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and BNT162b2 demonstrated a concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses which were TH-1 dominant against the RBD and the remainder of the full spike glycoprotein. Full information on previously released data can be found here. For further information about the ongoing Phase 3 trial, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov using the number NCT04368728.

About the EMA’s Rolling Review

Normally, all data on an investigational medicine’s efficacy, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a complete application for marketing authorization. In the case of a rolling review, the EMA’s CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before a complete application is submitted. Once the CHMP decides that sufficient data are available, the complete application should be submitted by the company. By reviewing the data as they become available, the CHMP can reach its opinion sooner on whether or not the investigational medicine or vaccine should be authorized. After a positive opinion, if adopted by the CHMP, it is the European Commission’s role to grant a Marketing Authorization.

 The collaboration will focus on development of specific antibody candidates identified by Vir’s platforms (VIR-7831 and VIR-7832) which demonstrated high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. The companies plan to proceed directly into P-II clinical trial within next 3 to 5 mos.
 Vir’s antibody platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, malaria, and others","Companies will combine their unique scientific and technical expertise to combat COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks
Promising antibody candidates for SARS-CoV-2 to be accelerated into phase 2 clinical trials within the next three to five months
GSK to make equity investment of $250 million in Vir
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to enter into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The collaboration will use Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Vir’s unique antibody platform has precedented success in identifying and developing antibodies as treatments for multiple pathogens, and it is highly complementary with our R&D approach to focus on the science of immunology. I am very excited that the talent and passion of our two companies will come together to develop solutions for multiple diseases, including the very promising antibody candidates targeting COVID-19.”
Due to the urgent patient need for COVID-19 solutions, the initial focus of the collaboration will be to accelerate the development of specific antibody candidates identified by the Vir platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. Subject to regulatory review, the companies plan to proceed directly into a phase 2 clinical trial within the next three to five months.
The collaboration will also utilise Vir’s CRISPR screening and machine learning approach to identify cellular targets whose inhibition can prevent viral infection. Vir has identified multiple potential targets against flu and other respiratory pathogens, as well as hepatitis B virus, and will now focus on SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, the companies have also agreed to conduct research into SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines by coupling GSK’s vaccines technologies and expertise with Vir’s ability to identify neutralising epitopes that are present across entire viral families. These efforts will be additive to other initiatives GSK is advancing to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19.
George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple therapeutic approaches, used in combination or in sequence, will be necessary to stop this coronavirus pandemic. It is likely that the current coronavirus outbreak will not be the last. These insights are informing our scientific approach and we are pleased to join forces on the execution of this strategy with GSK, who have a like-minded R&D strategy, a deep expertise in vaccines and an impressive global reach to bring medicines to people around the world.”
In addition, to gain access to Vir’s technology, GSK will make an equity investment in Vir of $250 million, priced at $37.73, a 10% premium to the closing share price on Friday, March 27, 2020. The equity investment and collaboration agreement will complete at the same time and are conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

Exact Sciences will compensate Pfizer based on the amount of services provided, along with additional fixed and performance-related fees set forth in the agreement
 Cologuard was approved by US FDA in August 2014 and is included in American Cancer Society’s (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines. It is indicated to screen adults (aged 45 yrs. and older) who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool
 Cologuard is the first and only FDA-approved non-invasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. It is an accurate, at-home colon cancer screening option and is uniquely positioned to support screening during this time and after the pandemic abates","MADISON, Wis. and NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced an extension and amendment of their agreement to promote Cologuard, the first and only FDA-approved non-invasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer. Under terms of the nationwide agreement, Pfizer will continue to provide marketing and related support for Cologuard and join Exact Sciences’ efforts to educate patients, physicians, and health systems about Cologuard.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for convenient, accurate cancer testing options. Outcomes can be dramatically improved if colorectal cancer is caught in early stages, and with more than an estimated one million screening colonoscopies missed this year, there is an urgent need to increase screening rates.1 Cologuard is an accurate, at-home colon cancer screening option and is uniquely positioned to support screening during this time and after the pandemic abates.

“We’re thrilled to continue working with Pfizer to increase screening rates with Cologuard, especially during this critical time,” said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. “Over the past two years, Pfizer has shown incredible commitment to Exact Sciences’ goal of eradicating colorectal cancer by helping detect the disease at its earliest, most treatable stages. The talented Exact Sciences team is excited to continue joining forces with Pfizer to help improve screening rates among the 46 million unscreened Americans.”

In the two years since the partnership began, more than 3 million people were screened with Cologuard and more than 90,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard for the first time. The combined teams have also introduced several new direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and worked with dozens of large health systems to improve colorectal cancer screening rates.

“Now more than ever, Pfizer’s purpose – breakthroughs that change patients’ lives – has taken on an even greater urgency. This partnership is a testament to that purpose, and Pfizer is incredibly proud of the work we have done with Exact Sciences to raise colorectal cancer screening rates,” said Mike Gladstone, Global President of Internal Medicine at Pfizer.

Under the terms of the amended agreement, Pfizer will provide sales and marketing support through the end of 2022 and health system support through the end of 2021. Exact Sciences will compensate Pfizer based on the amount of services provided, along with additional fixed and performance-related fees set forth in the agreement. Exact Sciences will maintain responsibility for all aspects of manufacturing and laboratory operations of Cologuard.

More information about the agreement is available here, in a form 8-K that Exact Sciences has filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

About Cologuard
Cologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014, and results from Exact Sciences’ prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the American Cancer Society’s (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults 45 years of age and older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool. Do not use Cologuard if you have had precancer, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes, or have a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. Cologuard performance in adults ages 45-49 is estimated based on a large clinical study of patients 50 and older. Cologuard performance in repeat testing has not been evaluated.

The Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again.

Medicare and most major insurers cover Cologuard. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.cologuardtest.com. Rx only.

INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced additional details on its SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody programs – including interim data on combination therapy in recently diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 – and plans to make these therapies broadly available to patients.

 Eli Lilly and Company logo. (PRNewsFoto, Eli Lilly and Company) (PRNewsfoto/Eli Lilly and Company) 

“Our teams have worked tirelessly the last seven months to discover and develop these potential antibody treatments,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We believe the data generated to date provide sufficient evidence that both monotherapy and combination therapy may be effective to treat COVID-19 in patients with a high risk for serious outcomes. Lilly is diligently working with regulators around the world to make these treatments available.”

Investors, media and the general public are invited to a conference call today at noon EDT, where Lilly will provide more data and discussion on these programs. The webcast information is available here. A replay will also be available on the website following the conference call.

Combination therapy clinical trial data
Data from a new interim analysis of the BLAZE-1 clinical trial showed that combination therapy with two of Lilly’s SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies reduced viral load, symptoms and COVID-related hospitalization and ER visits. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluated LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016, which bind complementary regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. The combination cohort enrolled recently diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who were assigned to 2800 mg of each antibody (n=112) or placebo (n=156).

The combination therapy significantly reduced viral load at day 11 (p=0.011), meeting the primary endpoint of the study. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, demonstrated near complete viral clearance by day 11. Further, combination treatment reduced viral levels at day 3 (p=0.016) and day 7 (p<0.001)—earlier time points during the course of infection when higher viral loads are typically seen. Combination therapy also significantly reduced the time-weighted average change from baseline from day 1 to 11. An exploratory analysis showed that the proportion of patients with persistent high viral load at day 7 for combination therapy was lower (3.0 percent) versus placebo (20.8 percent), corresponding to a nominal p value of p<0.0001 without multiplicity adjustment. No emergent putative resistance variants have been observed thus far in patients treated with combination therapy.

Combination therapy also met prespecified clinical endpoints, including the time-weighted average change from baseline in total symptom score from day 1 to 11 (p=0.009). The improvement in symptoms was observed as early as three days after dosing and was similar in magnitude and timing to improvements previously seen with LY-CoV555 monotherapy. The rate of COVID-related hospitalization and ER visits was lower for patients treated with combination therapy (0.9 percent) versus placebo (5.8 percent), a relative risk reduction of 84.5 percent (p=0.049). This was also similar to observations for LY-CoV555 monotherapy.

Combination therapy has been generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In LY-CoV555 monotherapy studies there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, all patients recovered). Treatment emergent adverse events were comparable to placebo for both LY-CoV555 monotherapy and combination therapy.

Lilly is working to publish the monotherapy and combination therapy data in peer-reviewed journals as soon as possible.

Manufacturing and supply update

To be able to quickly provide treatment to patients around the world, Lilly invested in large-scale manufacturing of both antibodies at risk – even before data demonstrated their potential to become a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.

For monotherapy, Lilly is focused on the 700 mg dose of LY-CoV555 since similar clinical effects were seen across all dose levels tested in BLAZE-1. Lilly anticipates it could supply as many as one million doses of 700 mg LY-CoV555 monotherapy in Q4 2020, with 100,000 available in October. With respect to the supply of combination therapy, Lilly anticipates it will have 50,000 doses available in Q4 2020. The supply of combination therapy will increase substantially beginning in Q1 2021, as additional manufacturing resources come online throughout the year, including Lilly’s recently announced manufacturing collaboration with Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN). Lilly is also pursuing additional partnerships to provide antibodies to resource-limited countries.

Regulatory update

Based on the combination therapy data, along with the previously disclosed findings for LY-CoV555 monotherapy, Lilly has engaged global regulators, including the FDA regarding potential EUA. Lilly has now submitted an initial request for EUA for LY-CoV555 monotherapy in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We expect to submit a subsequent request for EUA for combination therapy in November, pending clinical trial enrollment, once additional safety data accumulate and sufficient supply is manufactured. Lilly anticipates having data to support a biologics license application (BLA) submission for combination therapy as early as Q2 2021. Conversations with global regulators are ongoing.

The BLAZE-1 clinical trial (NCT04427501) continues to enroll a confirmatory cohort of higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, testing the ability of the antibody combination to reduce the number of patients with persistent high viral load and reduce COVID-related hospitalizations. In addition, Lilly is studying lower doses of combination therapy and alternative delivery options in planned or ongoing clinical trials. Other ongoing clinical trials include a Phase 3 study of LY-CoV555 monotherapy for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 monotherapy is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Data from these other ongoing trials are not yet available. Thus far, over 850 trial participants have been dosed with LY-CoV555 (alone or in combination with LY-CoV016), contributing to the safety data supporting this potential treatment.

Open-label pragmatic study in COVID-19 outpatients

To generate additional efficacy and safety data, Lilly plans to initiate a pragmatic, open-label study in the coming weeks, enrolling patients treated with either monotherapy or combination therapy, with a focus on collecting data regarding hospitalizations, deaths and safety.

Moving forward, LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 will be referred to as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, respectively.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

The monotherapy arms of the trial enrolled mild-to-moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying three doses of LY-CoV555 (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg) versus placebo. The combination arm of the trial enrolled mild-to-moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, studying LY-CoV555 2800 mg plus LY-CoV016 2800 mg versus placebo. Placebo patients were shared across all therapy arms in the completed cohorts.

The primary outcome measure for these completed arms of the BLAZE-1 trial was change from baseline to day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Additional endpoints include the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enroll an estimated 800 participants.

About bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555)
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed enrollment and primary safety assessments of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. A Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Lilly recently initiated a Phase 3 study for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987). In addition, LY-CoV555 is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

About etesevimab (LY-CoV016)
LY-CoV016 (also known as JS016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can effectively block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. A SARS-CoV-2 challenge study was conducted in rhesus macaques and showed LY-CoV016 is effective for both prophylactic and therapeutic venues against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lilly licensed LY-CoV016 from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of LY-CoV016 in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. LY-CoV016 has been well tolerated and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date.

October 07, 2020 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time
DURHAM, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Polarean Imaging plc (AIM: POLX), the medical‑imaging technology company, with an investigational drug‑device combination product for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), announces its submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) and request for priority review to the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for hyperpolarised 129Xenon gas used to evaluate pulmonary function and to visualise the lung using MRI.

The submission of the NDA follows the Company’s successful completion of two Phase III clinical trials (the “Clinical Trials”) which demonstrated effective measurement of regional lung ventilation. In the Clinical Trials, Polarean’s 129Xenon gas MRI was used to measure regional pulmonary function in patients with a wide variety of underlying lung diseases who were being evaluated for possible lung resection or lung transplant surgery. As detailed in the Company’s announcement of 29 January 2020, both Clinical Trials met their primary endpoints, showing pre-defined equivalence of hyperpolarised 129Xenon Gas MRI to an approved comparator, 133Xenon Scintigraphy, and displayed a benign safety profile.

129Xenon, when polarised in Polarean’s proprietary drug-device system, permits functional, regional and quantitative imaging of the lungs using MRI, without the risk of exposing patients to ionising radiation. The polarised 129Xenon is administered as an inhaled gas that is given to patients in a 10 second breath-hold MRI procedure.

Commenting on the submission, Richard Hullihen, CEO of Polarean, said: “The NDA submission of 129Xenon gas MRI as a drug-device combination represents another key regulatory milestone for our Company. I am delighted with the performance of Polarean’s team, who have worked tirelessly to achieve this important goal, and would also like to thank the institutions, clinicians and patients who took part in the studies that have formed part of this NDA.

“More than 30 million Americans suffer from a chronic lung disease and we see a significant unmet need for non-invasive, quantitative and cost-effective image-based diagnostic technology without exposing patients to ionising radiation. We look forward to working with the FDA to address this unmet need.”

This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014.

About Polarean (www.polarean.com)

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Polarean, Inc. (together the “Group”) are revenue-generating, medical drug-device combination companies operating in the high-resolution medical imaging market.

The Group develops equipment that enables existing MRI systems to achieve an improved level of pulmonary function imaging and specialises in the use of hyperpolarised Xenon gas (129Xe) as an imaging agent to visualise ventilation.129Xe gas is currently being studied for visualisation of gas exchange regionally in the smallest airways of the lungs, the tissue barrier between the lung, and the bloodstream and in the pulmonary vasculature. Xenon gas exhibits solubility and signal properties that enable it to be imaged within other tissues and organs.

The Group also develops and manufactures high performance MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils which are a required component for imaging 129Xe in the MRI system. The development of these coils by the Group facilitates the adoption of the Xenon technology by providing application-specific RF coils which optimize the imaging of 129Xe in MRI equipment for use as a medical diagnostic as well as a method of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.

50010,Eli Lilly Collaborates with Dexcom for Diabetes Management,Lilly and Dexcom team up on new program to help improve diabetes management,"The companies will partner to promote Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 & 200 units/mL) with Dexcom G6 CGM to aid HCPs in the US for the management of diabetes, including giving visibility to the benefits of a new mealtime insulin
 HCPs treating T1D & T2D will be able to assess their patient’s glucose levels and time in range with Dexcom G6 or Dexcom G6 Pro, helping them to manage PPG levels. The companies will enhance HCPs education by sharing information about Lyumjev & Dexcom G6 & G6 Pro via different channels
 Lyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro, act by speeding up the absorption of insulin in the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels in adults with diabetes and has received the US FDA’s approval on Jun 15, 2020","INDIANAPOLIS and SAN DIEGO, Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM) announced today a joint program for U.S. healthcare providers (HCPs) about Lilly’s new rapid-acting mealtime insulin Lyumjev™ (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL), now available in U.S. pharmacies, and Dexcom G6 CGM Systems. The program is designed to help clinicians use data to inform diabetes management, including giving visibility to the benefits of a new mealtime insulin.

HCPs treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be able to assess their patients’ glucose levels and time in range with Dexcom G6 or Dexcom G6 Pro, either in blinded or unblinded mode, helping them quickly identify adult patients who struggle to manage their postprandial glucose (PPG) levels (glucose levels following meals) and who may benefit from a treatment like Lyumjev. As PPG is often overlooked as a significant contributor to A1C,1 this partnership also aims to elevate PPG monitoring as an important component of diabetes treatment management.

“When it comes to treating diabetes, our partnership with Dexcom has the potential to be meaningful for HCPs who want to help their patients who may be struggling to manage their blood glucose levels after meals,” said Adrienne Brown, vice president, U.S. Diabetes and Connected Care, Lilly. “Through this program, we can inspire confidence as clinicians and their patients evaluate new treatment options by showcasing how using these resources together can inform diabetes care.”

Lilly and Dexcom will enhance HCP education by jointly sharing information about Lyumjev and the Dexcom G6 and G6 Pro through a variety of channels.

“We are thrilled to partner once again with a leader in diabetes care like Lilly,” said Rick Doubleday, chief commercial officer at Dexcom. “Our goal is that the real-time data provided through Dexcom G6 and Dexcom G6 Pro will allow healthcare providers to help their patients with diabetes make more informed decisions, measure and evaluate their time in range, and have more visibility to the potential benefits of transitioning to a new mealtime insulin such as Lyumjev.”

Those interested in learning more about Dexcom CGM or getting started on the Dexcom G6 should visit Dexcom.com. The Dexcom G6 is covered by 98 percent of private insurance in the U.S., by Medicare and by Medicaid in many states across the country. Dexcom also recently launched a patient assistance program available to current U.S. customers who lost their health insurance coverage due to the impacts of COVID-19.

Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels in adults with diabetes. In clinical studies, Lyumjev provided superior reduction in blood sugar spikes compared with Humalog® (insulin lispro injection) when blood sugar was measured 1 and 2 hours after a meal.

PURPOSE and SAFETY SUMMARY

Important Facts About LYUMJEV™ (LOOM-jehv) and Humalog® (HU-ma-log)

Lyumjev is also known as insulin lispro-aabc injection. Humalog is also known as insulin lispro injection.
Lyumjev is a fast-acting insulin. Lyumjev is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin. Humalog is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. Lyumjev and Humalog are available only with a prescription.
Lyumjev comes in two strengths: U-100 (100 units per milliliter) and U-200 (200 units per milliliter). The Lyumjev U-200 prefilled pen contains 2 times as much insulin per 1 milliliter as standard (U-100) insulin. Humalog U-100 contains 100 units of insulin per milliliter. The dose window of the pen shows the number of insulin units to be delivered.
It is not known if Lyumjev is safe and effective for children. It is not known if Humalog is safe and effective for children with type 2 diabetes or for children younger than 3 years of age with type 1 diabetes as there were no studies done with Humalog in these groups of children. If your doctor decides to give your child any insulin products, he or she may give you special instructions.
All Lyumjev and Humalog products contain insulin lispro.  

Warnings

Do not take Lyumjev or Humalog if you have:

symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
an allergy to Lyumjev or Humalog or any of their ingredients.
Do not reuse needles or share your insulin injection supplies with other people. This includes your:

prefilled pen for use by a single patient
cartridges
reusable pen that works with Lilly 3mL cartridges available for Humalog
needles
syringes
You or the other person can get a serious infection. This can happen even if you change the needle. 

Do not change the type of insulin you take or your dose, unless your doctor tells you to. This could cause low or high blood sugar, which could be serious.

Do not use a syringe to remove Lyumjev or Humalog from your prefilled pen. This can cause you to take too much insulin. Taking too much insulin can lead to severe low blood sugar. This may result in seizures or death.

Lyumjev and Humalog may cause serious side effects. Some of these can lead to death. The possible serious side effects are:

Low blood sugar. This can cause:
•    dizziness or lightheadedness

•    sweating

•    confusion

•    headache

•    blurred vision

•    slurred speech

•    shakiness

•    fast heartbeat

•    anxiety

•    irritability

•    mood change

•    hunger

If you are at risk of having severely low blood sugar, your doctor may prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. These are used when your blood sugar becomes too low and you are unable to take sugar by mouth. Glucagon helps your body release sugar into your bloodstream.

Severe allergic reaction.
Get emergency help right away if you have:
•    a rash over your whole body

•    trouble breathing

•    a fast heartbeat

•    sweating

•    a faint feeling

•    shortness of breath

•    extreme drowsiness

•    dizziness

•    confusion

•    swelling of your face, tongue,
or throat

Low potassium in your blood. This can lead to severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.
Heart failure. Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or “TZDs,” with Lyumjev or Humalog may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with Lyumjev or Humalog. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.
High blood sugar and ketoacidosis for Humalog insulin pump users. You can have these serious problems when your insulin pump or infusion set stops working. They can also happen if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, always keep extra insulin injection supplies with you.
Common side effects

The most common side effects of Lyumjev and Humalog are:

•    low blood sugar

•    allergic reactions

•    reactions where you have injected insulin

•    skin thickening or pits at the injection

      site

•    itching

•  weight gain

•    rash

Other most common side effects with Humalog include swelling of your hands or feet.

These are not all of the possible side effects. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You can report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Before using

Talk with your doctor about low blood sugar and how to manage it. Also tell your doctor:

about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
about any other prescription medicines you take, especially ones called TZDs.
about all of your medical conditions, including if you have heart failure or other heart, liver, or kidney problems.
if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.
How to take

Read the Instructions for Use that come with your Lyumjev or Humalog. Be sure to take your Lyumjev or Humalog and check your blood sugar levels exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to change your dose because of illness, increased stress, or changes in your weight, diet, or physical activity level. He or she may also tell you to change the amount or time of your dose because of other medicines or different types of insulin you take.

Before injecting your Lyumjev or Humalog

You can inject your insulin dose yourself, or you can have a trained caregiver inject it for you. Make sure you or your caregiver:

Check the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.
Use a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you re-use needles.
Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. Do not inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. Avoid injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.
When you are ready to inject

Inject Lyumjev under your skin at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.
Inject Humalog under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.
Staying safe while taking your Lyumjev or Humalog

To stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to never inject Lyumjev U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump.  Also be sure not to:

mix Lyumjev with other insulins
drive or use heavy machinery until you know how your Lyumjev or Humalog affects you.
drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol when taking your Lyumjev or Humalog.

50015,BMS' Zeposia (ozanimod) Receives Health Canada Approval for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"Health Canada Approves ZEPOSIA®, an Oral Treatment for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","The approval is based on P-lll SUNBEAM & RADIANCE part B study which involves the assessing of Zeposia (0.92mg and 0.46 mg) vs Avonex (qw, IM) in 1,346 & 1313 patients with RMS for 12 & 24mos. across 158 & 150 sites in 20 & 21 countries respectively
 Result: relative reduction in ARR (48% & 38%); absolute ARR (0.18 vs 0.35 & 0.17 vs 0.28). reduction in number of T1– weighted GdE (0.16 vs 0.43 & 0.18 vs 0.37); reduction in enlarging T2 brain lesions (1.47 vs 2.84 & 1.84 vs 3.18) respectively
 Zeposia is the only first line S1P receptor modulator approved in Canada for the treatment of RRMS, acts by decreasing the frequency of clinical exacerbations","Bristol Myers Squibb’s medication provides a new oral treatment option for Canadians living with the neurological disease

MONTREAL, Oct. 7, 2020 /CNW/ – Bristol Myers Squibb announced today that Health Canada approved ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) for the treatment of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations.

“Ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy in people living with multiple sclerosis can reduce the number of relapses and new brain lesions that form, but each person responds differently to different treatments. This is why having another treatment with meaningful efficacy to help decrease relapses and brain lesions is important,” said Dr. Jiwon Oh, Neurologist and MS specialist. “Today’s announcement is exciting because it addresses an unmet need for people when first diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. Having an oral treatment with evidence of higher efficacy than some other first-line treatments, and a good safety profile that is well-tolerated to manage clinical exacerbations and whole brain volume loss will be a benefit to people living with MS.”

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves; ii this causes inflammation and often damages the myelin in patches called lesions. iii When this happens, the normal flow of nerve impulse is delayed or blocked, leading to symptoms.iii

RRMS is characterized by unpredictable clinical exacerbations manifested by relapses (also known as attacks, exacerbations or flare-ups) and accumulation of lesions in the CNS during which new symptoms appear or existing ones get worse.ii

“Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological disease that impacts more than 77,000 Canadians,” said Dr. Pamela Valentine, president and CEO, MS Society of Canada. “With Canada having one of the highest prevalence rates in the world and no one size fits all approach to treatment, we want to continue seeing innovation and are pleased that there will be another effective oral treatment option.”

ZEPOSIA®  is an oral medication taken daily that helps protect against attacks on the nerves by stopping some of the body’s white cells (‘lymphocytes’) reaching the brain and spine where they could cause inflammation and damage to myelin, the nerves protective coating.i It is the only oral selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved in Canada as a first-line therapyi,iv for the treatment of RRMS. The approval is based on data from the two largest pivotal, head-to-head RRMS studies with an active comparator to date.v

“This approval reinforces our commitment to transforming patients’ lives and delivering innovative treatment options,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “Bringing to market a new oral treatment option for multiple sclerosis, a disease that impacts so many Canadians, gives us the opportunity to help improve the future for younger higher- functioning MS patients who need to maintain high physical and cognitive ability.”

The Health Canada approval is based on data from the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B clinical trials, which enrolled more than 2,600 patients across 150 sites in more than 20 countries.i,iv Key findings from the trials include:

ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg) demonstrated a relative reduction in ARR versus AVONEX® of 48 per cent through one year in the SUNBEAM study and 38 per cent at two years in the RADIANCE study (absolute ARR of 0.18 versus 0.35 and 0.17 versus 0.28, respectively).i,v,iv
At one year in the SUNBEAM study, treatment with ZEPOSIA® reduced the number of T1– weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX® (0.16 vs 0.43), a relative reduction of 63 per cent, and reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 brain lesions (1.47 versus 2.84), a relative reduction of 48 per cent.i,iv
At two years in the RADIANCE study, treatment with ZEPOSIA® reduced the number of T1– weighted GdE brain lesions more than AVONEX® (0.18 versus 0.37), a relative reduction of 53 per cent. ZEPOSIA® also reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions versus AVONEX® (1.84 versus 3.18), a relative reduction of 42 per cent.i,iv
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective covering of the nerves, called myelin, causing inflammation and damage. Myelin is necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses.ii

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by unpredictable but clearly defined relapses (also known as attacks, exacerbations or flare-ups) during which new symptoms appear or existing ones get worse. Approximately 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS.ii

Canada has one of the highest rates of multiple sclerosis in the world, with an estimated 77,000 people living with the disease. While it is most often diagnosed in young adults aged 20 to 49, younger children and older adults are also diagnosed.ii

About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period. iv The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 158 sites in 20 countries.iv

The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period.iv The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12.iv

About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double- dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA® (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1313 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.v

The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months.v The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months and the number of MRI T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 24 months.v

About ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod)
ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) is for the treatment of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations.i It is the only first line sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved in Canada for the treatment of RRMS. ZEPOSIA® binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5 to reduce the number of attacks.i It is taken orally as a capsule, once daily, with or without food.i

50023,BioMarin Receives the US FDA's Approval Allowing Maximum Dose of 60mg with Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz) for PKU,"BioMarin, Pioneer in Rare Disease Treatments for Phenylketonuria (PKU), Receives FDA Approval of Label Expansion to Allow Maximum Dose of 60 mg for Palynziq® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection for Treatment of Adults with PKU","The US FDA has approved the sBLA to increase the maximum allowable dose of 60mg with Palynziq for PKU. Previously, the maximum dose was 40mg
 The label expansion is based on OLE study out to 3yrs. demonstrating that 66% had a blood Phe level ≤360 μmol/L consistent with the Phe target ACMG recommended guidelines @2yrs. of treatment and 50% had blood Phe levels ≤120 μmol/L @2yrs. 75%, 66% & 48% had a blood Phe ≤600, 360, and 120 μmol /L, respectively @3yrs. of treatment
 Additional, safety data with over 6yrs. of follow up remains consistent with the previous safety profile of Palynziq irrespective of dose. Moreover, BioMarin has dosed the first participant in the global Phearless P-I/II study of BMN 307 for PKU","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Oct. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:BMRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to increase the maximum allowable dose of 60 mg with Palynziq® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection for treatment of adults with Phenylketonuria (PKU).  Previously, the maximum dose was 40 mg.  In the Phase 3 PRISM studies, 19% of study participants required a 60 mg dose to achieve adequate response to Palynziq.

The label expansion includes the addition of longer-term efficacy data demonstrating sustained phenylalanine (Phe) lowering out to three years and over six years of data further supporting a well-characterized safety profile. The labeling was updated to allow individualized maintenance dosage to achieve blood Phe control (blood Phe concentrations less than or equal to 600 μmol/L), taking into account patient tolerability to Palynziq and dietary protein intake.

Palynziq is indicated to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adults with phenylketonuria (PKU), who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 μmol/L on existing management.  Palynziq, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, is the first and only approved enzyme substitution therapy to target the underlying cause of PKU by helping the body to break down Phe.

Palynziq is BioMarin’s second approved treatment for this serious condition.  BioMarin also recently announced that the Company had dosed the first participant in the global Phearless Phase 1/2 study of BMN 307, an investigational gene therapy for people with PKU, and potentially its third approved treatment.  BMN 307 has Fast Track Designation in the US, as well as Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and E.U.

This labeling long term data update is based on efficacy data from an open-label extension study out to three years demonstrating that two-thirds (66%) of the 86 participants treated for at least two years, had a blood Phe level ≤360 μmol/L consistent with the Phe target in American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommended guidelines, and 50% of participants had blood Phe levels ≤120 μmol/L at two years. Of the 77 participants treated for at least three years, 58 (75%), 51 (66%), and 37 (48%) had a blood Phe concentration less than or equal to 600, 360, and 120 μmol /L, respectively, at three years of treatment.  Additional safety data with over six years of follow up remains consistent with the previous safety profile of Palynziq, irrespective of dose.

PKU is a rare genetic disease that manifests at birth and results in a variety of cumulative toxic effects on the brain. PKU affects approximately 1 in 12,500 live births in the United States each year. PKU is marked by an inability to break down Phe, an amino acid that is found in all forms of protein. Left untreated, high levels of Phe become toxic to the brain and may lead to serious neurological and neuropsychological impairment, affecting a person’s ability to think and problem solve, and can lead to depression, anxiety, and behavior disturbance impacting quality of life. Due to the seriousness of these symptoms, infants are screened at birth to ensure that they are diagnosed early and treated to avoid intellectual disability and other complications. Individuals living with PKU require life-long management, including adherence to a challenging and severely restrictive daily diet of medical foods and formula that avoids the ingestion of Phe that is present in most foods.

“BioMarin is pleased that the FDA has recognized the importance of including an additional dosing option to individuals with PKU.  Consistent with the label in Europe, Palynziq is now available in the U.S. at doses of up to 60 mg,” said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioMarin.  “BioMarin remains committed to the PKU community and continues to build on our 15 plus years of research and development, which enabled us to deliver the first two PKU drug therapies.  We continue our commitment to further understand the safety and efficacy of our treatments for PKU.  We are grateful to the study participants, investigators, study staff and BioMarin employees who were essential to enable this label expansion.”

“Adding a maximum dose of 60 mg allows more patients to optimize and achieve treatment goals to keep blood Phe levels within the range set in the medical guidelines or within normal range,”  said Cary Harding, M.D., professor at Oregon Health & Science University and Steering Committee Chair for the Palynziq program.  “More than six years of long-term safety data further supports a well-characterized safety profile similar to the initial data and is important information to physicians considering a chronic therapy.”

“It is essential to the PKU community to have treatment options that can control Phe levels and provide long term data on safety and efficacy as it becomes available.  The additional information added to the Palynziq label, particularly the long-term safety follow-up demonstrates BioMarin’s ongoing commitment to people with PKU,” said Christine Brown, MS, executive director of the National PKU Alliance. “BioMarin’s 15-year focus on innovative medical research to advance the standard of care in PKU with an existing treatment and for new treatments is transforming the way that the community thinks about this rare genetic disease.”

BioMarin’s 15-Plus Year Commitment to PKU Research

For more than 15 years, BioMarin has been a pioneer in ongoing research to help improve the lives of PKU patients.  BioMarin has developed therapies that have been used to treat approximately 7,000 PKU patients around the world.  The company has two approved PKU therapies, and an investigational gene therapy BMN 307 is currently in development.  BioMarin has conducted 41 clinical studies in PKU and has sponsored 44 external clinical studies.  BioMarin researchers have authored 65 publications in medical and scientific journals on PKU and supported another 57 publications by external researchers.

About Phenylketonuria

PKU, or phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 diagnosed patients in the regions of the world where BioMarin operates and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme PAH. This enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If the active enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU under the age of 40 in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after. PKU can be managed with a severe Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the life-long strict diet to the extent needed to achieve adequate control of blood Phe levels.  Dietary control of Phe in childhood can prevent major developmental neurological toxicities, but poor control of Phe in adolescence and adulthood is associated with a range of neurocognitive disabilities with significant functional impact.

About ACMG Guidelines

Practice guidelines issued by ACMG support the need for lifelong management of Phe levels in patients with PKU.  The diagnosis and management guidelines were published online in Genetics In Medicine’s Advance Online Publication (AOP) service.

The guidelines state that treatment of PKU should be initiated as early as possible and must be continued throughout adulthood and “lifelong,” with a goal of maintaining blood levels of Phe for all patients between 120 to 360 micromol/L. Patients treated from the early weeks of life with initial good metabolic control, but who lose that control in later childhood or adult life, may experience both reversible and irreversible neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences.

According to the guidelines “the primary goal of therapy is to lower blood Phe, and any interventions, including medications, or combination of therapies that help to achieve that goal in an individual, without other negative consequences, should be considered appropriate therapy.”

Evidence for the guidelines are drawn from two previous independent review processes from the National Institutes of Health (2001) and the Agency for Health Research and Quality (2012). The guidelines can be accessed here.

About Palynziq

Palynziq substitutes the deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme in PKU with the PEGylated version of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase to break down Phe. Palynziq is administered using a dosing regimen designed to facilitate tolerability; Palynziq’s safety profile consists primarily of immune-mediated responses, including anaphylaxis, for which robust risk management measures effective in clinical trials are in place.

The dosing and administration of Palynziq follows an induction, titration, and maintenance paradigm.  Treatment is individualized to the lowest effective and tolerated dosage.  Prescribers may consider increasing from 20 mg to 40 mg in patients who have been on 20 mg once daily continuously for at least 24 weeks and who have not achieved blood Phe control.  Prescribers may increase dosage to a maximum of 60 mg once daily in patients who have been on 40 mg once daily continuously for at least 16 weeks and who have not achieved blood Phe control.  Prescribers are instructed to discontinue treatment in patients who have not responded after 16 weeks of continuous treatment with the maximum dosage of 60 mg once daily.  Periodic blood Phe monitoring is recommended, and patients should be counseled on how to adjust their dietary intake, as needed, based on blood Phe concentrations.

INDICATION

PALYNZIQ® (pegvaliase-pqpz) is a phenylalanine (Phe)-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood Phe levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels greater than 600 micromol/L on existing management.

BOXED WARNING: RISK OF ANAPHYLAXIS

Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment
Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection. Prior to self-injection, confirm patient competency with self-administration, and patient’s and observer’s (if applicable) ability to recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, if needed
Consider having an adult observer for patients who may need assistance in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis during PALYNZIQ treatment. If an adult observer is needed, the observer should be present during and for at least 60 minutes after PALYNZIQ administration, should be able to administer auto–injectable epinephrine, and call for emergency medical support upon its use
Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on its appropriate use. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during PALYNZIQ treatment
PALYNZIQ is available only through a restricted program called PALYNZIQ REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies, is available at www.PALYNZIQREMS.com or by telephone at 1-855-758-REMS (1-855-758-7367)
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Anaphylaxis

Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis reported include syncope, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, chest discomfort/chest tightness, tachycardia, angioedema (swelling of face, lips, eyes, tongue), throat tightness, skin flushing, rash, urticaria, pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea)
Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 1 hour after injection; however, delayed episodes occurred up to 48 hours after PALYNZIQ administration
Consider having an adult observer for patients who may need assistance in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis during PALYNZIQ treatment. If an adult observer is needed, the observer should be present during and for at least 60 minutes after PALYNZIQ administration, should be able to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and call for emergency medical support upon its use
Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with auto-injectable epinephrine. Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients receiving PALYNZIQ and instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during PALYNZIQ treatment. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, how to properly administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Consider the risks associated with auto-injectable epinephrine use when prescribing PALYNZIQ. Refer to the auto-injectable epinephrine prescribing information for complete information
Consider the risks and benefits of readministering PALYNZIQ following an episode of anaphylaxis. If the decision is made to readminister PALYNZIQ, administer the first dose under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis and closely observe the patient for at least 60 minutes following the dose. Subsequent PALYNZIQ dose titration should be based on patient tolerability and therapeutic response
Consider premedication with an H1-receptor antagonist, H2-receptor antagonist, and/or antipyretic prior to PALYNZIQ  administration based upon individual patient tolerability
Other Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions other than anaphylaxis have been reported in 204 of 285 (72%) patients treated with PALYNZIQ in clinical trials
Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, recurrence of the reaction, and the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider, and may include dosage adjustment, temporary drug interruption, or treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (at least 20% of patients in either treatment phase) were injection site reactions, arthralgia, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, cough, oropharyngeal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, nasal congestion, fatigue, dizziness, and anxiety
Of the 285 patients exposed to PALYNZIQ in an induction/titration/maintenance regimen in clinical trials, 44 (15%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were hypersensitivity reactions (6% of patients) including anaphylaxis (3% of patients), angioedema (1% of patients), arthralgia (4% of patients), generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients), and injection site reactions (1% of patients)
The most common adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction were arthralgia (15% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (9% of patients), injection site reactions (4% of patients), alopecia (3% of patients), and generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients)
The most common adverse reactions leading to temporary drug interruption were hypersensitivity reactions (14% of patients), arthralgia (13% of patients), anaphylaxis (4% of patients), and injection site reactions (4% of patients)

50080,Lilly and Incyte's Olumiant (baricitinib) Reports Additional Data Demonstrating Reduction in COVID-19 Recovery Time,"Baricitinib has Significant Effect on Recovery Time, Most Impactful in COVID-19 Patients Requiring Oxygen","The companies shared the additional efficacy and safety data of the ACTT-2 study demonstrating baricitinib + remdesivir reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection compared with remdesivir as monothx
 The biggest benefits were observed in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (grade 5 on the eight-point ordinal scale) and those who required high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (grade 6) at baseline
 Additionally, Eli Lilly is in talks with the US FDA for EUA of baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed to Lilly from Incyte) to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) are sharing additional data showing baricitinib in combination with remdesivir reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection compared with remdesivir. This finding was part of additional efficacy and safety data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) presented today by John Beigel, M.D., associate director for clinical research in the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at NIAID. These data were presented at a special International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Diseases Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) Virtual Conference on ‘Therapeutics for COVID-19.’ The largest benefits were observed in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (grade 5 on the eight-point ordinal scale) and those who required high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (grade 6) at baseline.

New data presented today provide a better understanding of the improved clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection who received baricitinib, including data for mortality. As previously reported, ACTT-2 achieved the primary endpoint, demonstrating that the overall patient population treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir improved their median time to recovery from 8 to 7 days in comparison to remdesivir, a 12.5% improvement (incidence rate ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.32; p=0.04). Recovery was defined as the participant being well enough for hospital discharge, meaning the participant either no longer required supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care in the hospital, or was no longer hospitalized at Day 29. The study also met a pre-specified secondary endpoint. Using the ordinal scale that ranged from recovered to death, the odds of improvement in clinical status at Day 15 were 30% greater in patients being treated with baricitinib in combination with remdesivir compared with remdesivir (odds ratio 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6; p=0.04).

A numerical decrease in death (35%) through Day 29 was observed in patients treated with baricitinib plus remdesivir compared to remdesivir in the overall population (5.1% vs. 7.8%, respectively; hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.08; p=0.09). The reduction in mortality was more pronounced for patients receiving oxygen, as mortality at Day 29 was 60% lower and 43% lower for the OS5 and OS6 subgroups respectively. No new safety signals were observed for baricitinib-treated patients in this study. NIAID authors are working to have the full analysis completed and a peer-reviewed manuscript will be made available soon.

“We are excited that these results add to the potential role for baricitinib to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” said Ilya Yuffa, Lilly senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “Lilly is committed to identifying impactful preventions and treatments, and we are engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the potential to make baricitinib available to hospitalized patients as quickly as possible.”

Lilly is continuing conversations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) around the potential for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor licensed to Lilly from Incyte, to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In the U.S., baricitinib has not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY: Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

50087,Neurocrine Presents New Data Analyses of Ongentys (opicapone) for Parkinson Disease at ANA 2020 Virtual Meeting,Neurocrine Biosciences to Present New Data Analyses of Once-Daily ONGENTYS® (opicapone) in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease at the American Neurological Association 2020 Virtual Meeting,"In a post-hoc, sub-group analysis of the P-III BIPARK-1 study demonstrated greater reductions in overnight “off” time and time to morning “on” time compared to entacapone in patients with PD with motor fluctuations
 The new P-III post-hoc sub-group analysis demonstrated that long-term treatment with Ongentys when used as an add-on therapy reduced “On” time with troublesome dyskinesia and increased good “On” time without troublesome dyskinesia in patients with PD with motor fluctuations
 Long term use of therapy leads to a reduction in the patient’s average daily levodopa dosage requirement. Ongentys (qd, PO) is a selective and reversible COMT inhibitor and has received the US FDA’s approval as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with PD experiencing “off” episodes","SAN DIEGO, Sept. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced it will present data analyses evaluating the efficacy and safety of ONGENTYS® (opicapone) capsules, recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first and only once-daily catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor as an add-on to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off” episodes. New data from a post-hoc, sub-group analysis of Phase III data showed that ONGENTYS led to greater reductions in overnight “off” time and time to morning “on” time compared to entacapone in patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations. In another Phase III post-hoc sub-group analysis, long-term use of ONGENTYS in patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations reduced “on” time with troublesome dyskinesia and increased good “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia. In this analysis, long-term use of ONGENTYS was associated with a reduction in the patient’s average daily levodopa dosage requirement. These data will be presented in collaboration with BIAL at the American Neurological Association (ANA) 2020 Virtual Meeting on October 4–9, 2020.

“As Parkinson’s disease progresses and the benefit of treatment with levodopa/carbidopa begins to wear off between doses, many patients experience increased fluctuation and unpredictability in their motor function, which can include more ‘off’ time overnight and during the day, and a reduction in good ‘on’ time where movement is close to normal,” said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. “These post-hoc analyses from the Phase III clinical trials of ONGENTYS provide further insight on how adding once-daily ONGENTYS to levodopa/carbidopa can help patients with Parkinson’s disease better manage disruptive motor fluctuations over the course of the day.”

The six ONGENTYS abstracts that will be presented at the ANA 2020 Virtual Meeting are:

Long-Term Efficacy of Opicapone in the Reduction of ON-Time with Troublesome Dyskinesia in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations and Reporting Troublesome Dyskinesia (Poster #489)
Effects of Once-Daily Opicapone on Duration of Overnight OFF and Time to Morning ON in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease and Motor Fluctuations (Poster #494)
Efficacy of Opicapone at Different Levodopa Regimens up to a Threshold of 600 mg/day Levodopa in Parkinson’s Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations (Poster #490)

About Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately one million people in the United States and six million people worldwide. Parkinson’s disease is caused by low dopamine levels produced in the brain. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that control all purposeful movements, including talking, walking and writing. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, dopamine production steadily decreases, resulting in increased problems with motor symptoms including slowed movement (bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity, impaired posture and balance, and difficulty with speech and writing.

There is presently no cure for Parkinson’s disease and management of the disease consists of the use of treatments that attempt to control motor symptoms primarily through dopaminergic mechanisms. The current gold standard for treatment of motor symptoms is levodopa/carbidopa. While levodopa/carbidopa improves patients’ motor symptoms, as the disease progresses, the beneficial effects of levodopa begin to wear off more quickly. Patients then experience motor fluctuations throughout the day between “on” time, periods when the medication is working and Parkinson’s disease symptoms are controlled, and “off” time, when the medication is not working and motor symptoms return.

About ONGENTYS® (opicapone) Capsules 
ONGENTYS is a unique, once-daily, oral, peripheral, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off” episodes. ONGENTYS inhibits the COMT enzyme, which breaks down levodopa, making more levodopa available to reach the brain.

In June 2016, BIAL – Portela & CA, S.A. (BIAL) received approval from the European Commission for ONGENTYS as an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations. BIAL currently markets ONGENTYS in Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Neurocrine Biosciences in-licensed opicapone from BIAL in 2017 and has exclusive development and commercialization rights in the U.S. and Canada.

50102,J&amp;J to Supply EU with up to 400M Doses of its COVID-19 Vaccine,Johnson & Johnson Announces European Commission Approval of Agreement to Supply 200 Million Doses of Janssen’s COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate,"EC has approved an advance purchase agreement in which the Janssen will supply 200 M doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate to EU member states following approval from regulators. Additionally, the EU member states have an option to secure up to 200M additional doses
 The agreement follows the conclusion of exploratory talks with the EC. Apart from the agreement, J&J plans to allocate up to 500M vaccine doses toward international efforts for ensuring access in lower income countries, with delivery beginning in mid-2021, following approval
 J&J is evaluating a single dose regimen in P-III ENSEMBLE study initiated in Sept’2020 and plans the initiation of P-III study with a two-dose regimen later this year","New Brunswick, N.J., October 8, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced the European Commission (EC), acting on behalf of the European Union (EU) Member States, has approved an Advance Purchase Agreement in which the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies will supply 200 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to EU Member States following approval or authorization from regulators. The EU Member States also have the option to secure up to 200 million additional doses.

“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten communities worldwide and we have a responsibility to ensure access to our COVID-19 vaccine as soon as we can. We appreciate the Commission’s and the Member States’ support for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate and development efforts,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

This contract follows the conclusion of exploratory talks with the EC. The Company is in ongoing discussions with other stakeholders, including national governments and global organizations, as part of its efforts to meet its commitment to make its vaccine candidate accessible globally, provided the vaccine has a good safety profile, is efficacious and receives approval or authorization from regulators.

Separate to the agreement with the EC, as part of the Company’s larger commitment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson & Johnson has also announced plans to allocate up to 500 million vaccine doses toward international efforts to ensure access for lower income countries, with delivery beginning mid next year following approval or authorization from regulators. Recognizing the unique global demand for COVID-19 vaccines, we are working tirelessly to further expand the number of available doses.

Johnson & Johnson is developing and testing Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate in accordance with its usual rigorous ethical standards of safety and sound scientific principles. The Company is evaluating a single-dose regimen in its large-scale, pivotal, multi-country Phase 3 trial (ENSEMBLE) that started in September. A second Phase 3 study with a two-dose regimen is planned to start later this year. The Company is committed to transparency and sharing information related to the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study – including the study protocol.

Janssen’s investigational COVID-19 vaccine leverages Janssen’s AdVac® technology. The same technology was used to develop Janssen’s EC-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and is the basis for its HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates. To date, more than 100,000 individuals have been vaccinated with a Janssen AdVac®-based vaccine. Based on our understanding of the stability of our vaccines, we anticipate our COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be compatible with standard distribution channels without the need for new distribution infrastructure.

50110,Amgen Report Mixed Results of Omecamtiv Mecarbil in P-lll GALACTIC-HF Study for Heart Failure,"Amgen, Cytokinetics And Servier Announce Topline Results From GALACTIC-HF, A Phase 3 Trial Of Omecamtiv Mecarbil In Patients With Heart Failure","The P-lll GALACTIC-HF study involves the assessing of Omecamtiv mecarbil (25mg, bid with the maintenance dose of 50 mg, 37.5mg, or 25mg, bid) vs PBO in 8,256 patients with HFrEF
 Result: The study met its 1EPs of reduction in CV death or HF events (HF hospitalization and other urgent treatment for HF) while the study did not meet its 2EPs of reduction in time to CV death, presented at AHA 2020
 Omecamtiv mecarbil is a cardiac myosin activator, targeting the contractile mechanisms of the heart, being developed under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SURESNES, France, Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Cytokinetics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:CYTK) and Servier today announced topline results from GALACTIC-HF, a Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

The results of GALACTIC-HF show that treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil achieved the primary composite efficacy endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant effect to reduce cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99, p=0.0252).

No reduction in the secondary endpoint of CV death was observed. Adverse events, including major ischemic cardiac events, were balanced between treatment arms. Additional analyses of data are underway and results from GALACTIC-HF will be presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2020, in a virtual Late Breaking Clinical Trial session on Friday, November 13, 2020 from 10:35-10.45 a.m. CDT.

Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart.

“The outcomes observed in GALACTIC-HF further the understanding of treating heart failure, a devastating disease in which half of heart failure patients will die within five years of initial hospitalization,” said David M. Reese, M.D. executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “At Amgen, we remain committed to developing and delivering transformative medicines that improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease.”

“GALACTIC-HF provides insights into effects associated with targeting cardiac muscle contractility with omecamtiv mecarbil to treat heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction,” said Fady I. Malik, M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics’ executive vice president of Research & Development. “We are grateful to the trial investigators, site personnel, patients and caregivers who participated in the trial, and we look forward to further data analyses and the presentation of the results of this Phase 3 trial at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.”

“Heart failure is a devastating condition jeopardizing patients’ lives every day. We are pleased to have collaborated with Amgen and Cytokinetics on one of the largest heart failure trials ever conducted to investigate this novel therapy in patients with heart failure. It is important to now turn our attention to fully analyzing the data from this important study in this clinical setting,” said Claude Bertrand, PharmD, PhD, Executive Vice President R&D at Servier.

GALACTIC-HF: Trial Design
GALACTIC-HF,2 (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), one of the largest Phase 3 global cardiovascular outcomes studies in heart failure ever conducted, enrolled 8,256 patients in 35 countries with HFrEF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, elevated natriuretic peptides and either current hospitalization for heart failure or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for heart failure within a year. Patients were randomized to either oral placebo or a starting dose of 25 mg omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily (maintenance dose of 50 mg, 37.5 mg, or 25 mg twice daily) guided by pharmacokinetic-guided dose selection. A blood test, the QMS Omecamtiv Mecarbil Immunoassay (the OM Test) was used to measure plasma levels of omecamtiv mecarbil in each patient in order to guide selection of the appropriate maintenance dose.

The primary composite endpoint of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial was time to CV death or first heart failure event (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure). Secondary endpoints were: time to CV death, patient reported outcomes (measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Total Symptom Score [TSS]), time to first heart failure hospitalization and time to all-cause death.

About Omecamtiv Mecarbil and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program
Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational selective cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart, binding to and recruiting more cardiac myosin heads to interact with actin during systole. Preclinical research has shown that omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption.3-5 Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force resulting in cardiac contraction. 

Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier. Omecamtiv mecarbil is the subject of a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trials program composed of GALACTIC-HF and METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity.

About Heart Failure
Heart failure is a grievous condition that affects more than 64 million people worldwide6 about half of whom have reduced left ventricular function.7,8 It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in people age 65 and older.9,10 Despite broad use of standard treatments and advances in care, the prognosis for patients with heart failure is poor.11 An estimated one in five people over the age of 40 are at risk of developing heart failure, and approximately 50 percent of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within five years of initial hospitalization.12,13

About Cytokinetics and Amgen Collaboration
In 2006, Cytokinetics and Amgen entered into a strategic alliance to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate the cardiac sarcomere for the potential treatment of heart failure. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier. Amgen holds an exclusive, worldwide license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics’ specified development and commercialization rights. Cytokinetics is eligible for pre-commercialization and commercialization milestone payments and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement. Cytokinetics has co-invested with Amgen in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for increased royalties from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan and co-promotion rights in institutional care settings in North America.  Amgen has also entered an alliance with Servier for exclusive commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia. Servier contributes funding for development and provides strategic support to the program.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration or potential collaboration in pursuit of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 (including statements regarding such collaboration’s, or our own, ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, and/or to produce any such antibodies to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen’s manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen’s products, the commercialization of Amgen’s product candidates, and Amgen’s clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen’s product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

Cytokinetics Forward-Looking Statements

If EUA is granted, the US govt. has committed to making REGN-COV2 available in the US at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution
 The company reported that there are doses available for ~50,000 patients and expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months
 REGN-COV2 is a combination of two mAbs, REGN10933 & REGN10987, designed to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The company reported that a single 8g dose of REGN-COV2 was given to President Donald Trump following a compassionate-use request from doctors as part of a treatment regimen","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said that it submitted a request to the FDA seeking emergency-use authorization for its REGN-COV2 investigational antibody combination for the treatment of COVID-19. REGN-COV2 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, which has been designed to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

The disclosure came the same day that Eli Lilly announced that it submitted an EUA request to the FDA for its neutralising IgG1 monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 for use in higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Available in US at no cost
According to Regeneron, under an agreement with the US government, if an EUA is granted, the government has committed to making REGN-COV2 available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution. The company noted that currently there are doses available for approximately 50,000 patients, while it expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months.

Regeneron reported early study results last month showing that the addition of REGN-COV2 to standard-of-care reduced viral load as well as the time to symptom alleviation in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the company more recently confirmed that a single 8g dose of REGN-COV2 was given to President Donald Trump following a compassionate-use request from his doctors as part of a treatment regimen also including Gilead Sciences’ antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) and the steroid dexamethasone.

Trump touts REGN-COV2
Following treatment and amid his ongoing recovery from COVID-19, Trump said REGN-COV2 was “the key” to his positive outcome. “I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president,” he remarked, adding that “I think we’re going to work it so you’re going to get [REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV555] and you’re going to get ’em free,” with distribution handled by the military.

Further, Trump’s doctor said that a recent blood test showed that the president had detectable levels of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, which had not been present in a test prior to receiving REGN-COV2. Regeneron noted that it is not possible for the blood test to distinguish between antibodies made by Trump himself and those from REGN-COV2.  Company spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said that given the volume of antibodies delivered in REGN-COV2, and the timing of the tests, “it is likely that the second test is detecting REGN-COV2 antibodies.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Website-Size-6-2.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,0,0,Approve|COVID-19|Emergency|Regeneron|REGN-COV2|Seeks|Use|USFDA,publish,9/10/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/regeneron-asks-fda-to-approve-emergency-use-of-regn-cov2-for-covid-19/,https://pharmashots.com/50117/regeneron-seeks-the-us-fdas-eua-for-regn-cov2-antibody-combination-to-treat-covid-19/
50125,Takeda Signs ~$1B Pact with Arrowhead for ARO-AAT Targeting Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease,Takeda and Arrowhead Collaborate to Co-Develop and Co-Commercialize ARO-AAT for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease,"Arrowhead to receive ~$300M up front, ~$740M as development, regulatory and commercial milestones and is eligible to receive royalties of 20-25% on net sales
 If approved, the companies will co-develop ARO-AAT and co-commercialize it in the US, under 50/50 profit sharing structure. Additionally, Takeda will lead the global commercialization strategy and get an exclusive license to commercialize the therapy outside the US
 ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the hepatic production of the Z-AAT protein and is potential first-in-class therapy designed to treat the underlying cause of liver disease associated with AATD","Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop ARO-AAT, a Phase 2 investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapy in development to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin-associated liver disease (AATLD). ARO-AAT is a potential first-in-class therapy designed to reduce the production of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, the cause of AATLD progression.

Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda and Arrowhead will co-develop ARO-AAT which, if approved, will be co-commercialized in the United States under a 50/50 profit-sharing structure. Outside the U.S., Takeda will lead the global commercialization strategy and receive an exclusive license to commercialize ARO-AAT with Arrowhead eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20-25% on net sales. Arrowhead will receive an upfront payment of $300 million and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to $740 million. Closing of the transaction is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.

“AAT-associated liver disease is a devastating condition for which there are no approved therapies. With its RNAi-based mechanism of action, ARO-AAT has the potential to treat the underlying cause of AATLD, thereby helping patients avoid the need for liver transplantation and associated co-morbidities,” said Asit Parikh, M.D., Ph.D., Head, Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “We are excited to collaborate with Arrowhead to bring forward this exciting late-stage liver asset for the Alpha-1 community as part of our growing GI portfolio.”

“Takeda’s global presence and experience with payers and regulators in the rare disease and GI therapy space, combined with its long history serving the Alpha-1 community make it the ideal partner for ARO-AAT. It is well-positioned to work with the patient and medical community to help meet the severe unmet need of patients with Alpha-1 liver disease,” said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., President and CEO at Arrowhead. “This agreement also supports our strategy of using partnering selectively to continue to invest in our Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform and the growing pipeline of RNAi therapeutics targeting diverse tissue types, while focusing our commercial organization on opportunities in two key areas of cardiometabolic and pulmonary.”

 

About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Liver Disease
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Associated Deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder associated with liver disease in children and adults and pulmonary disease in adults. AATD is estimated to affect 1 per 3,000-5,000 people in the United States and 1 per 2,500 in Europe. The protein AAT is primarily synthesized and secreted by liver hepatocytes. Its function is to inhibit enzymes that can break down normal connective tissue. The most common disease variant, the Z mutant, has a single amino acid substitution that results in improper folding of the protein. The mutant protein cannot be effectively secreted and accumulates in globules inside the hepatocytes. This triggers continuous hepatocyte injury, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Individuals with the homozygous PiZZ genotype have severe deficiency of functional AAT leading to pulmonary disease and liver disease. Lung disease is frequently treated with AAT augmentation therapy. However, augmentation therapy does nothing to treat liver disease, and there is no specific therapy for hepatic manifestations. There is a significant unmet need as liver transplant, with its attendant morbidity and mortality, is currently the only available cure.

 

About ARO-AAT
ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the hepatic production of the mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin (Z-AAT) protein, the cause of progressive liver disease in AATD patients. Reducing production of the inflammatory Z-AAT protein is expected to halt the progression of liver disease and potentially allow it to regenerate and repair.

 

Takeda in Gastroenterology
We believe that GI and liver diseases are not just life disrupting conditions, but diseases that can impact a patient’s quality of life.[i],[ii] Beyond a fundamental need for effective treatment options, we understand that improving patients’ lives also depends on their needs being recognized. With nearly 30 years of experience in gastroenterology, Takeda has made significant strides in addressing GI patient needs with treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), acid-related diseases, short bowel syndrome (SBS), and motility disorders. We are making significant strides toward closing the gap on new areas of unmet needs for patients who have celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin-associated liver disease, Crohn’s disease, and acute pancreatitis, among others. Together with researchers, patient groups and more, we are working to advance scientific research and clinical medicine in GI.

NEU-ISENBURG, Germany & FRANKFURT, Germany & NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– The German Breast Group (GBG) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the collaborative Phase 3 PENELOPE-B trial did not meet the primary endpoint of improved invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (eBC) who have residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No unexpected safety signals were observed.

PENELOPE-B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing one year of palbociclib plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy to placebo plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy. The trial is sponsored by the GBG as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer and other study groups.

“Reducing the risk of disease recurrence in patients who have residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a complex clinical challenge,” said Professor Sibylle Loibl, Chair of GBG. “This unique trial was made possible through the collaboration and support from all the research partners involved. Despite this outcome, we believe that key learnings will emerge from the large number of biomarkers being analyzed from collected tumor tissue, which will help inform future breast cancer research.”

“This is the first randomized Phase 3 study to establish mature iDFS results for a CDK4/6 inhibitor as part of the adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer. While we are disappointed with this result, we look forward to continuing to work with our research partners to understand subgroup data and how these could inform the development of our next-generation CDK inhibitors in early breast cancer,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We are proud of the transformative impact IBRANCE has had on the treatment of HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer – a vastly different treatment setting than early breast cancer. Our commitment to the metastatic patient community is as strong as ever as we continue to generate new data, including the most extensive body of real-world evidence for a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.”

Detailed findings from PENELOPE-B will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.

About the PENELOPE-B Study

PENELOPE-B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing one year of palbociclib plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy to placebo plus at least five years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in 1,250 women with HR+, HER2- eBC at high risk of recurrence who have residual invasive disease after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in the trial scored 3 or higher (or 2 if there were lymph node metastases at the time of surgery) on the clinical-pathologic stage – estrogen/grade (CPS-EG). The CPS-EG is a validated risk assessment tool combining: clinical stage before neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and estrogen-receptor status. The trial is sponsored by the GBG as part of a clinical research collaboration with other study groups, including ABCSG, AGO-B, ANZBCTG, BIG, CCTG, GEICAM, LACOG, IBCSG, ICORG, ISPy-2, JBCRG, KCSG, NSABP, Unicancer and Pfizer.

More than 190 clinical sites in 12 countries around the globe participated in PENELOPE-B. The study opened in November 2013 and closed recruitment on December 31, 2017.

About IBRANCE® (palbociclib) 125 mg tablets and capsules

IBRANCE is an oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6,1 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression.2,3 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women or in men; or with fulvestrant in patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy.

IBRANCE currently is approved in more than 95 countries and has been prescribed to nearly 340,000 patients globally. IBRANCE is not indicated for early breast cancer.

The full U.S. Prescribing Information for the IBRANCE tablets and the IBRANCE capsules can be found here and here.

IMPORTANT IBRANCE®(palbociclib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 (80%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-2, Grade 3 (56%) or 4 (10%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (55%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever.

Monitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 15 of first 2 cycles and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including IBRANCE when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. Across clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.0% of IBRANCE-treated patients had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3 or 4, and no fatal cases were reported. Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities reported.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, dyspnea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have developed pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently discontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis.

Based on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients to consider sperm preservation before taking IBRANCE. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.

The most common adverse reactions(≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (80% vs 6%), infections (60% vs 42%), leukopenia (39% vs 2%), fatigue (37% vs 28%), nausea (35% vs 26%), alopecia (33% vs 16%), stomatitis (30% vs 14%), diarrhea (26% vs 19%), anemia (24% vs 9%), rash (18% vs 12%), asthenia (17% vs 12%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 1%), vomiting (16% vs 17%), decreased appetite (15% vs 9%), dry skin (12% vs 6%), pyrexia (12% vs 9%), and dysgeusia (10% vs 5%).

The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66% vs 2%), leukopenia (25% vs 0%), infections (7% vs 3%), and anemia (5% vs 2%).

Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were decreased WBC (97% vs 25%), decreased neutrophils (95% vs 20%), anemia (78% vs 42%), decreased platelets (63% vs 14%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (52% vs 34%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (43% vs 30%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%).

The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%).

Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), decreased platelets (62% vs 10%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (43% vs 48%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (36% vs 34%).

Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers. The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure.

For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the recommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg. The pharmacokinetics of IBRANCE have not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.

50158,AstraZeneca Advances its AZD7442 in Two P-III Clinical Studies for COVID-19,COVID-19 Long-Acting AntiBody (LAAB) combination AZD7442 rapidly advances into Phase III clinical trials,"The two studies of AZD7442 will enroll ~6,000 adults for the prevention of COVID-19 in and outside the US, expected to begin in next wk. with additional trials enrolling ~4,000 adults for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
 The first study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to 12mos. in ~5,000 participants while the second trial will assess post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in ~1,100 participants
 AstraZeneca has received ~$486M from US Govt. and plans to supply ~100,000 doses and can acquire other 1M doses. AZD7442 is a combination of 2 LAABs derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection","Two trials of AZD7442 will enrol over 6,000 adults for the prevention of COVID-19 with additional trials enrolling ~4,000 adults for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections
US Government to invest ~$486m for development and supply of up to 100,000 doses and can acquire another one million doses
AstraZeneca’s long-acting antibody (LAAB) combination, AZD7442, will advance into two Phase III clinical trials in more than 6,000 participants at sites in and outside the US that are due to begin in the next weeks. The LAABs have been engineered with AstraZeneca’s proprietary half-life extension technology to increase the durability of the therapy for six to 12 months following a single administration. The combination of two LAABs is also designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The Company has received support of around $486m from the US Government for the development and supply of AZD7442 under an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD7442 to prevent infection for up to 12 months, in approximately 5,000 participants. The second trial will evaluate post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in approximately 1,100 participants.

AstraZeneca is planning additional trials to evaluate AZD7442 in approximately 4,000 patients for the treatment of COVID-19.

AstraZeneca plans to supply up to 100,000 doses starting towards the end of 2020 and the US Government can acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This agreement with the US Government will help accelerate the development of our long-acting antibody combination which has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating COVID-19 infections. We will be evaluating the LAAB combination in different settings from prophylaxis, to outpatient treatment to hospitalisation, with a focus on helping the most vulnerable people.”

LAABs mimic natural antibodies and have the potential to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus, as well as to be given as a preventative intervention prior to exposure to the virus. A LAAB combination could be complementary to vaccines as a prophylactic agent, e.g. for people for whom a vaccine may not be appropriate or to provide added protection for high-risk populations. It could also be used to treat people who have been infected.

Today’s agreement builds on previous funding of more than $25m from US government agencies BARDA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the discovery and evaluation of the monoclonal antibodies, as well as the Phase I clinical trial started in August 20201 to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy individuals.

Financial considerations
The agreement is not anticipated to impact the Company’s financial guidance for 2020 as the US Government funding is being offset by expenses to progress the clinical trials of AZD7442 as well as manufacturing process and upscaling costs. Should the Phase III trials prove successful and AZD7442 become an approved medicine, the Company anticipates providing the medicine at commercial terms during and after the current coronavirus pandemic.

AZD7442
AZD7442 is a combination of two LAABs derived from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020, the LAABs were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extended LAABs should afford six to 12 months of protection from COVID-19.2-5 The reduced Fc receptor binding aims to minimise the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease – a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies promote, rather than inhibit, infection and/or disease.6

In a recent Nature publication, the LAABs were shown in pre-clinical experiments to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.7

The approval of HALPRYZA® (rituximab injection) will bring a new option to Chinese Lymphoma patients, help them to improve quality of life & prolong their survivals.”  

About Malignant Lymphoma

Malignant lymphoma is one of the most common hematological malignancies in China. It is one of the top ten malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the incidence of malignant lymphoma has been rising. According to histopathology, lymphoma can be divided into Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), of which NHL accounts for the majority. NHL is a general term for a series of related but different lymphoid malignant tumors. Most (80-85%) originates from B cells. The rest originate from T cells or NK cells. More than 95% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells express CD20. The incidence of NHL increases with age. The most common type of NHL in China is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), accounting for 40-50% (about 30-40% in Western countries). DLBCL is a moderately malignant to highly malignant invasive lymphoma that progresses rapidly and leads to the death of patients within a few months without treatment.

About HALPRYZA® (rituximab injection)

HALPRYZA® is rituximab injection and a recombinant human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody drug. Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on the surface of B lymphocytes and mediates complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Normal and malignant B cells are targeted for destruction by the antibody, thereby achieving anti-tumor and immunosuppressive therapeutic effects.

50180,Novartis's Iptacopan (LNP023) Receives EMA's Prime Designation for C3 Glomerulopathy,Novartis received European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation for iptacopan (LNP) in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G),"EMA has granted PRIME designation for iptacopan (LNP023) in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). PRIME designation enhancing the development of medicine targeting unmet medical need. Results of P-II interim analysis for iptacopan in C3G will be presented at ASN 2020
 Additionally, the company is investigating iptacopan in P-III study in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 Ab therapy, planned to initiate in Dec’2020. The P-II data in PNH presented at EBMT
 Iptacopan is an oral, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor B and has received FDA’s & EMA’s ODD in C3G, based on the preliminary data from the ph2 trial","Basel, October 9, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME designation for iptacopan (LNP023) in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary program is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can potentially reach patients earlier.

C3G is an ultra-rare and severe form of primary glomerulonephritis, characterized by complement dysregulation.1,7 It has a worldwide annual incidence of 1–2 per million8 and an approximate prevalence of 10,000 in the US, ~10,500 in Europe, 3,200 in Japan and 32,000 in China9.

C3G is commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. The disease has a poor prognosis; about 50% of patient progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, and 50–70% experience disease recurrence post kidney transplant.2

Results from a Phase II interim analysis for iptacopan in C3G will be presented at the virtually held American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 Annual Meeting from October 22-25, 2020.

About iptacopan
Iptacopan is a first-in-class oral, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor B, a key serine protease of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.4,5

In addition to C3G, iptacopan is in parallel development for a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and membranous nephropathy.

Novartis is also investigating iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Following positive Phase II data presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August10, a randomized, active-comparator controlled open-label Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in PNH patients with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 antibody therapy is planned to start in Dec 2020.11

Iptacopan has the potential to become the first alternative pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement driven diseases. Based on the preliminary data from the ph2 trial, Iptacopan has received orphan designations by FDA and EMA in C3G.

In interim analyses, patients were randomized equally into 5 arms, with Tremfya (200/600/1200 mg (IV) @0, 4 & 8wks. respectively or with ustekinumab, dosed at ~6mg/kg (IV) @0wk. and dosed 90 mg (SC) @8wks. or PBO
 @12wks. (Tremfya vs PBO), reductions in CDAI (154.1, -144.3, -149.5 vs -36.0); patients achieving clinical remission vs PBO (CDAI<150): (54.0%, 56.0%, 50.0% vs 15.7%); clinical remission among conventional therapy failures & among patients who had previously failed biologic therapy, (61.6% vs 18.5% & 45.5% vs 12.5%) respectively
 @12wks, Tremfya induced greater improvement across key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures, with a safety profile consistent with approved indications. Tremfya is a mAb that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor","SPRING HOUSE, Pa., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced Phase 2 interim data from the GALAXI 1 study, which showed TREMFYA® (guselkumab) demonstrated results at week 12 in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapies and/or biologics.1 At 12 weeks, TREMFYA induced significantly greater improvements compared to placebo across key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures, with a safety profile consistent with approved indications.1 TREMFYA is not currently approved for the treatment of CD in the U.S.2

These new data are being presented today as an oral presentation (Abstract OP089) at the 28th United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week, which is conducting its annual congress virtually.1

“While there have been substantial treatment breakthroughs in Crohn’s disease, there are still patients who are not gaining benefit from any of the currently approved mechanisms of action for their symptoms,” said lead study investigator William J. Sandborni, M.D., Chief of Gastroenterology, Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, who is delivering the oral presentation virtually at UEG Week. “I am encouraged by these early data, which show that TREMFYA across three different dosing groups induced a significant response in key clinical and endoscopic outcome measures in Crohn’s disease.”

GALAXI 1 evaluated the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA compared with placebo in CD. The interim analyses reported results through week 12 from the first 250 patients enrolled. Approximately 50 percent of patients had previously failed biologic therapy; and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with moderately to severely active CD (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI], mean 306.6; Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease [SES-CD], median 11.0). Patients were randomized equally into five treatment arms, including treatment with TREMFYA dosed at 200, 600 or 1200 mg intravenously (IV) at weeks 0, 4 and 8, respectively; or treatment with ustekinumab dosed at ~6mg/kg IV at week 0 and then dosed at 90 mg subcutaneously (SC) at week 8; or placebo.1

At week 12, there were significantly greater reductions from baseline in the CDAI observed in each TREMFYA group (200, 600 or 1200 mg IV doses) compared with placebo (Least Squares [LS] means: -154.1, -144.3, -149.5 versus -36.0, respectively; all p<0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients assigned to each TREMFYA dose achieved clinical remission compared with placebo (CDAI<150): 54.0 percent, 56.0 percent, 50.0 percent, respectively, versus 15.7 percent (p<0.001). Among conventional therapy failures, 61.6 percent in the TREMFYA-combined group versus 18.5 percent treated with placebo achieved clinical remission at week 12. Among patients who had previously failed biologic therapy, 45.5 percent in the TREMFYA-combined group compared with 12.5 percent in the placebo group achieved clinical remission at week 12.1

Furthermore, at week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with TREMFYA achieved clinical response (p<0.001), patient reported outcome (PRO)-2 remission (p<0.001), clinical-biomarker response (p<0.001), and endoscopic response (p<0.001) compared with patients treated with placebo. Endoscopic healing is an important outcome for long-term disease control; 37.3 percent of patients in the TREMFYA-combined group compared with 11.8 percent in the placebo group achieved endoscopic response after only 12 weeks of induction treatment (p<0.001).1

“For patients living with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, including those who have not had an adequate response or have intolerance to other therapies, these results show that TREMFYA may play an important role as a new treatment option pending results from the ongoing registration trials,” said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Although more research is needed, we are encouraged by the data and the potential role for selective IL-23 inhibition in helping patients manage their Crohn’s disease symptoms and treating the underlying disease process.”

TREMFYA demonstrated a safety profile consistent with that established from prior clinical trials across approved indications. Observed adverse events (AEs) were generally similar amongst treatment groups and placebo through week 12. In the TREMFYA 200, 600, 1200 mg IV and placebo treatment groups, serious AEs occurred in 4 percent, 4 percent, 2 percent and 4 percent, and serious infections occurred in 2 percent, 0 percent, 0 percent and 0 percent of patients, respectively. There were no reported deaths in TREMFYA-treated patients, and no TREMFYA-treated patient had active tuberculosis, serious hypersensitivity reactions or malignancies.1

About the GALAXI 1 trial1,3
GALAXI 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 dose-ranging study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease with inadequate response/intolerance to conventional therapies (corticosteroid, immunosuppressive) and/or biologics (TNF antagonist, vedolizumab). Patients will receive treatment through up to 3 years.

Interim analyses at week 12 evaluated the key outcomes of change in CDAI score from baseline, clinical remission (CDAI<150), clinical response (decrease from baseline in CDAI ≥100 or CDAI<150), PRO-2 remission (abdominal pain mean daily score ≤1 and mean daily stool frequency score ≤3), clinical biomarker response (clinical response and ≥50% reduction from baseline in C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin), endoscopic response (≥50% improvement from baseline in the SES-CD), and safety in patients treated with TREMFYA compared with placebo. The efficacy and safety of the reference arm (ustekinumab) compared with placebo was also evaluated and demonstrated.

About Crohn’s disease (CD)
CD is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans.4 CD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause, but the disease is associated with abnormalities of the immune system that could be triggered by a genetic predisposition, diet or other environmental factors.5 Symptoms of CD can vary but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever.5,6 There is currently no cure for CD.6

About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)
Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA® is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.2 TREMFYA® is approved in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).2 It is approved in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis.7

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA®.

All patients completing 44wks. were eligible to enter the LTE program, continuing their current regimen ~252wks.
 50%+ patients were randomized to q8w dosing and continued to receive this dosage in the LTE study, maintained CR (57%) and remission (55 %) through 5 yrs. of treatment while (93%) were steroid-free. Among patients who had prior exposure to & failed to TNF-α biologics, clinical remission (59% & 44%) respectively
 Stelara is a fully human mAb & is the first and only biologic treatment to selectively inhibit the (IL)-12 and IL-23 pathways and is approved in the US for multiple diseases","SPRING HOUSE, Pa., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced new, final five-year data from the Phase 3 IM-UNITI open-label, long-term extension (LTE) study which showed treatment of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) maintained long-term remission1 through five years.2,i

These data are being presented today as an oral presentation (Abstract OP110) at the 28th United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week, which is conducting its annual congress virtually.2

“Crohn’s disease is among the most debilitating forms of inflammatory bowel disease, disrupting the lives of millions of patients worldwide,” said lead study investigator William J. Sandbornii, M.D., Chief of Gastroenterology, Professor of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, who is delivering the oral presentation virtually at UEG Week. “Results from the IM-UNITI study showed that patients were able to maintain response with STELARA treatment through five years. Notably, for those patients in clinical remission, the majority (greater than 90 percent) who received continuous treatment with q8w STELARA were steroid-free at five years.”

The key findings showed more than half of the patients with moderately to severely active CD who were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) STELARA every 8 weeks (q8w) and continued to receive this dosage in the LTE study maintained clinical response3 (57 percent) and remission (55 percent) through five years of treatment. Of these patients in clinical remission, 93 percent were steroid-free.2

Additionally, among the subgroup of these patients who had never previously been exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) biologics, 59 percent were in clinical remission after five years of receiving SC STELARA q8w maintenance treatment. Further, among the subgroup of these patients who had previously failed (i.e. were refractory to) or who were intolerant to anti TNF-α therapy, 44 percent were in clinical remission after five years of receiving SC STELARA q8w maintenance treatment. Approximately half (51 percent, [290/567]) of all patients (randomized and assigned) who entered the LTE study completed their final dosing visit.2

Through five years, the event rates (per one hundred patient years) for adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and serious infections for the q8w STELARA group were generally comparable to the event rates in the placebo group. Antibody to STELARA rates through week 272 remained low, occurring in 5 percent of patients assigned to receive STELARA in the maintenance study and continuously receiving the approved 90 mg SC q8w regimen in the LTE. No new safety signals were observed.2

“Crohn’s disease is a chronic, lifelong condition, so it’s important to understand the long-term outcomes of therapies in order to effectively address the disease,” said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “These results from the LTE study with STELARA bring us further insights on the long-term management of this chronic disease.”

Janssen is presenting a total of 16 abstracts at this year’s UEG Week congress of which seven are oral presentations.

About the IM-UNITI trial4
IM-UNITI, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of STELARA maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. Patients who had responded to a single intravenous dose of STELARA in the UNITI-1 or UNITI-2 induction studies were randomized equally to receive maintenance SC STELARA 90 mg q8w or q12w, or placebo. There were 1,281 patients enrolled in the maintenance study.2 In randomized patients who met loss of response criteria between weeks 8–32, a one-time dose adjustment to 90 mg q8w occurred. All patients completing week 44 were eligible to enter the long-term extension program, continuing their current regimen up to week 252.

About Crohn’s Disease (CD)
CD is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans.5 CD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause, but the disease is associated with abnormalities of the immune system that could be triggered by a genetic predisposition, diet or other environmental factors.6 Symptoms of CD can vary but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever.6,7 There is currently no cure for CD.7

About STELARA® (ustekinumab)8

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
STELARA® is a prescription medicine that affects your immune system. STELARA® can increase your chance of having serious side effects including:

Serious Infections
STELARA® may lower your ability to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. While taking STELARA®, some people have serious infections, which may require hospitalization, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.

Your doctor should check you for TB before starting STELARA® and watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with STELARA®.
If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated for TB before and during treatment with STELARA®.
You should not start taking STELARA® if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

Before starting STELARA®, tell your doctor if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as:
fever, sweats, or chills
muscle aches
cough
shortness of breath
blood in phlegm
weight loss
warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
diarrhea or stomach pain
burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal
feel very tired
are being treated for an infection.
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back.
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB.
After starting STELARA®, call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of an infection (see above). STELARA® can make you more likely to get infections or make an infection that you have worse. People who have a genetic problem where the body does not make any of the proteins interleukin 12 (IL–12) and interleukin 23 (IL–23) are at a higher risk for certain serious infections that can spread throughout the body and cause death. People who take STELARA® may also be more likely to get these infections.

Cancers
STELARA® may decrease the activity of your immune system and increase your risk for certain types of cancer. Tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of cancer. Some people who had risk factors for skin cancer developed certain types of skin cancers while receiving STELARA®. Tell your doctor if you have any new skin growths.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)
RPLS is a rare condition that affects the brain and can cause death. The cause of RPLS is not known. If RPLS is found early and treated, most people recover. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems including: headache, seizures, confusion, and vision problems.

Serious Allergic Reactions
Serious allergic reactions can occur. Stop using STELARA® and get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction such as: feeling faint, swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat, chest tightness, or skin rash.

Lung Inflammation
Cases of lung inflammation have happened in some people who receive STELARA® and may be serious. These lung problems may need to be treated in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop shortness of breath or a cough that doesn’t go away during treatment with STELARA®.

Before receiving STELARA®, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have any of the conditions or symptoms listed above for serious infections, cancers, or RPLS.
ever had an allergic reaction to STELARA® or any of its ingredients. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
are allergic to latex. The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains latex.
have recently received or are scheduled to receive an immunization (vaccine). People who take STELARA® should not receive live vaccines. Tell your doctor if anyone in your house needs a live vaccine. The viruses used in some types of live vaccines can spread to people with a weakened immune system, and can cause serious problems. You should not receive the BCG vaccine during the one year before receiving STELARA® or one year after you stop receiving STELARA®.
have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.
are receiving or have received allergy shots, especially for serious allergic reactions.
receive or have received phototherapy for your psoriasis.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if STELARA® can harm your unborn baby. You and your doctor should decide if you will receive STELARA®.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is thought that STELARA® passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you receive STELARA®.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over–the–counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

When prescribed STELARA®:

Use STELARA® exactly as your doctor tells you to.
STELARA® is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of your doctor. In children 6 years and older, it is recommended that STELARA® be administered by a healthcare provider. If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may give your injections of STELARA® at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject STELARA®. Your doctor will determine the right dose of STELARA® for you, the amount for each injection, and how often you should receive it. Do not try to inject STELARA® yourself until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject STELARA® by your doctor or nurse.
Common side effects of STELARA® include: nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose, upper respiratory infections, fever, headache, tiredness, itching, nausea and vomiting, redness at the injection site, vaginal yeast infections, urinary tract infections, sinus infection, stomach pain, diarrhea, and joint pain. These are not all of the possible side effects with STELARA®. Tell your doctor about any side effect that you experience. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Please read the full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for STELARA® and discuss any questions you have with your doctor.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1–800–FDA–1088.

50218,Takeda Reports Results of Entyvio (vedolizumab) in Interim Analysis from VISIBLE OLE Study for Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis,Safety and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Entyvio® (Vedolizumab) Sustained During Long-term Maintenance Therapy in Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis,"The ongoing P-IIIb VISIBLE OLE study involves assessing of Entyvio (SC) in adult patients with UC or CD, following enrolment and participation in the VISIBLE 1 (UC) or VISIBLE 2 (CD) studies. Patients who completed the maintenance period up to 52wks. (randomized completers) or who achieved clinical response @14wks. (non-randomized 14wks. responders) after a third IV infusion @6wks., received Entyvio (SC, 108mg, q2w)
 Interim analysis from VISIBLE OLE study showed long-term findings consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab with maintained rates of clinical remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission
 Entyvio is the first maintenance biological therapy approved across the EU in both IV and SC formulations to treat moderately to severely active UC or CD. VISIBLE OLE results presented at UEG Week Virtual 2020 congress","Osaka, JAPAN, October 12, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced interim results from the VISIBLE open-label extension (OLE) study on the long-term safety and efficacy of maintenance treatment with the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the gut-selective biologic Entyvio® (vedolizumab) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).
In evaluating the primary safety endpoint of the trial, interim data of the UC patient population showed that following two years of maintenance therapy with vedolizumab SC, long-term safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab.1 Patients also continued to demonstrate clinical benefit from treatment, through maintenance of clinical remission* and corticosteroid-free clinical remission** rates, the clinical efficacy outcomes of the trial.1 These data were announced in an oral presentation at the UEG Week Virtual 2020 congress.

VISIBLE OLE is an ongoing open-label, phase 3b, multinational, multicenter study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of vedolizumab SC in adult patients with UC or CD, following enrolment and participation in the VISIBLE 1 (UC) or VISIBLE 2 (CD) studies.1,2 Participants who completed the maintenance period up to week 52 (randomized completers), or who achieved clinical response at week 14 after a third vedolizumab IV infusion at week 6 (non-randomized week 14 responders), received vedolizumab SC 108 mg every two weeks.1,2 Interim data from the VISIBLE OLE study in the UC patient population demonstrated that adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of vedolizumab.1 During two years of maintenance treatment,adverse events occurred in 69% of patients with UC, with disease exacerbations (18%), nasopharyngitis (11%), upper respiratory tract infection (9%), and anemia (7%) reported most frequently.1 Injection site reactions were reported in 4.5% of patients and all were mild or moderate in severity.1 Serious adverse events occurred in 14% of patients, with no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and no deaths.1

In randomized completers, rates of clinical remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission were maintained up to week 108 (week 6: 71.0% [n=49/69] and week 108: 68.9% [n=42/61], respectively; week 52: 78.3% [n=18/23] to week 108: 70.0% [n=14/20], respectively).1 In non-randomized week 14 responders, the comparative rates were 62.6% [n=67/107] at week 14 and 33.3% [n=31/93] at week 110 for clinical remission, and 24.5% [n=12/49] at week 54 and 25.0% [n=11/44] at week 110 for corticosteroid-free clinical remission.1

“These latest safety and effectiveness data for vedolizumab SC provide additional support/data that the benefits received from subcutaneous vedolizumab are sustained during long-term maintenance therapy,” said Asit Parikh, MD PhD, Head of Takeda’s Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit. “Entyvio® SC was approved by the European Commission in May 2020, offering greater choice on mode of administration in line with the diverse medical needs and preferences of patients, plus the option of home-administration outside of the medical setting. Takeda’s commitment to gastrointestinal innovation continues and we are working to develop a needle-free jet injector application that would broaden choice for patients even further.”

* Clinical remission is defined as a partial Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 point1
** Corticosteroid-free clinical remission is defined as patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline (week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission1

About the VISIBLE Clinical Trial Program
The VISIBLE clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD).

The VISIBLE program consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 UC and CD patients which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at week 52, and an open-label extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC.2,3,4

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).5 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, with CD potentially progressing over time.6,7 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.8,9 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.8,9 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.8,10 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.6 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.8,11,12

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations.13,14 The SC formulation is currently approved in Europe, Canada and Australia only. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).15 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.16 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.15 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).15,17,18 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.15

Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.13,14 Vedolizumab has been granted marketing authorization in over 70 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 510,000 patient years of exposure to date.19

Therapeutic Indications for vedolizumab

Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.

 

Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.

Important Safety Information for vedolizumab

Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

Special warnings and special precautions for use
Intravenous vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering intravenous vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.

Infusion-related reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.

Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. No systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.

Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.

Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.

Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.

Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue, injection site reactions and anaphylaxis.

Injection Site Reactions (subcutaneous vedolizumab)
No clinically relevant differences in the overall safety profile and adverse events were observed in patients who received subcutaneous vedolizumab compared to the safety profile observed in clinical studies with intravenous vedolizumab with the exception of injection site reactions (with subcutaneous administration only). Injection-site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and none were reported as serious.

Please consult with your local regulatory agency for approved labeling in your country.

50225,Lilly Reports Results of Mirikizumab in P-ll SERENITY Study for Crohn's Disease,Mirikizumab Shows Continued Symptom Improvement and Reduction of Intestinal Inflammation in Patients with Crohn’s Disease in 52-Week Phase 2 Trial,"The P-ll SERENITY study involves the assessing of Mirikizumab (200mg, 600mg, 1000mg) vs PBO in patients in the ratio of 2:1:1:2 with moderately to severely active CD. The P-II study includes 12wks. induction period and 40wks. continued treatment period, evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple dosing regimens and two methods of administration @52wks.
 Result: @52wks. ~60% achieved endoscopic responses (58.5% in IV dosing group and 58.7% in the SC group) while 45% + achieved PRO remission (46.3% in the IV group and 45.6% in the SC group), presented at UEG Week 2020
 Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to the P19 subunit of interleukin 23 and being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, UC, & CD","INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced today new efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 SERENITY study evaluating mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause systemic inflammation manifested as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss and lead to intestinal obstruction, fibrosis and other complications. SERENITY included a 12-week induction period and 40-week continued treatment period, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of multiple dosing regimens and two methods of administration through Week 52 as measured by endoscopic response, which reflects substantial reduction in inflammation of the lining of the bowel as seen during an endoscopy, and by Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) remission, two important treatment goals in Crohn’s disease. Detailed results from the trial are being presented virtually today in an abstract session at the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEG Week) 2020.

In the induction period, patients were randomized across four treatment arms to receive placebo or one of three doses of mirikizumab intravenously. At 12 weeks, patients who showed endoscopic improvement were randomized to continue mirikizumab treatment, administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. Patients who did not show endoscopic improvement or who had been randomized to the placebo arm in induction were assigned to receive mirikizumab treatment intravenously.

In the continued treatment period of the study, patients achieved key secondary outcomes at Week 52 including endoscopic response (defined as at least 50% reduction from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease [SES-CD]), PRO remission (defined as an average daily stool frequency of ≤2.5 and abdominal pain ≤1 and no worse than baseline) and endoscopic remission (defined as achieving an SES-CD score <4 for ileal-colonic disease or <2 for isolated ileal disease, and no subscore >1).

Endoscopic response: Nearly 60% of patients achieved endoscopic response (58.5% in the randomized IV dosing group and 58.7% in the SC group).
PRO remission: More than 45% of patients achieved PRO remission (46.3% in the IV group and 45.6% in the SC group).
“Crohn’s disease is a serious and difficult-to-treat condition, and there is a significant need for additional treatments. I am encouraged by the results of this study, which showed response in both symptom relief and endoscopic response and remission at 52 weeks of treatment with mirikizumab,” said Bruce E. Sands, MD, MS, Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine, Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Among the subset of patients who achieved endoscopic response at Week 12, 69.6% and 66.7% in the IV (n=23) and SC (n=24) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic response at Week 52. Additionally, among those with endoscopic remission at Week 12, 50.0% and 64.3% in the IV (n=6) and SC (n=14) groups, respectively, also had endoscopic remission at Week 52.

“People who live with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease need additional treatment options and are looking for innovative therapies that can address their challenging and painful symptoms,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “With these encouraging Phase 2 results, we look forwarding to continuing our clinical program for mirikizumab with the hope that we can provide help for those living with Crohn’s disease.”

One patient in each group among those who showed endoscopic improvement at Week 12 discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). Similar frequencies of treatment-emergent AEs and serious AEs were reported in IV and SC groups. The most common treatment-emergent AEs reported were nasopharyngitis (4.9% in IV group, 13% in SC group), headache (7.3% in IV group, 8.7% in SC group) and arthralgia (joint pain) (7.3% in IV group, 13% in SC group).

At UEG Week, Lilly also virtually presented additional results for mirikizumab from the Phase 2 Crohn’s disease study as well as data on bowel urgency and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).

About Mirikizumab
Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the P19 subunit of interleukin 23. Mirikizumab is being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

About Crohn’s Disease
Crohn’s disease, which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic immune-mediated condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Crohn’s most commonly affects the end of the small bowel (the ileum) and the beginning of the colon, but it may affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. IBD, which is inclusive of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, affects 10 million people worldwide.

About the Mirikizumab Phase 2 Trial in Crohn’s Disease
SERENITY, the Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. At baseline, participants were randomized with a 2:1:1:2 allocation across four treatment arms (mirikizumab 200 mg, mirikizumab 600 mg, mirikizumab 1000 mg, and placebo). The primary endpoint was endoscopic response as determined by the proportion of participants achieving at least 50 percent reduction from baseline on the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD) at Week 12. In May 2019, Lilly reported Phase 2 results showing more patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease receiving mirikizumab achieved clinical remission and response at 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile at 12 weeks was consistent with that of mirikizumab in studies of ulcerative colitis and with the class.

50236,Abbott's AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM Test Receives the US FDA's EUA for COVID-19,Abbott Receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 IgM Antibody Blood Test,"Abbott has received the US FDA’s EUA for AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM lab-based serology test for use on the ARCHITECT and Alinity platforms
 Till now, Abbott has received EUA for its seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and, an IgG Ab test for COVID-19
 The IgM test demonstrated 99.56% specificity and 95.00% sensitivity for patients tested 15 days after symptom onset. The test will give a more complete picture of where patients are in their recovery","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Oct. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the company’s AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Immunoglobulin M) lab-based serology test for use on the ARCHITECT® and Alinity™ platforms. IgM antibody testing can play an important role in understanding if someone has developed antibodies in response to the virus, indicating a recent or prior infection.

The new IgM antibody test is Abbott’s latest test to support in the fight against COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, Abbott has received emergency use authorization for seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and an IgG antibody test.

“Abbott has developed tests to detect the virus at each stage of infection so doctors and their patients are equipped with knowledge of how they are responding to the virus and progressing through recovery,” said Robert B. Ford, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. “Antibody tests will continue to play an important role to better understand the virus, the prevalence of COVID-19 in an area and where a patient may be in their recovery.”

Understanding a person’s immune response with antibody tests

While molecular tests detect whether someone has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone had a previous infection by detecting antibodies, such as IgM and IgG.

Abbott first developed an IgG blood test, which often is the antibody that is longer-lasting in the body after infection. This test has been widely adopted and continues to play a key role in understanding if someone has recovered from the virus, as well as contact tracing and epidemiological studies.1

The IgM antibody, in comparison, is most useful for determining a recent infection as these antibodies become undetectable weeks to months following infection.2 Having this more complete picture of where a patient is in their recovery can help healthcare providers determine if treatment, isolation or follow-up visits are needed.

Similar to Abbott’s IgG blood test, the IgM test has demonstrated high reliability in both Abbott’s research and external virology laboratory studies. Abbott’s data demonstrated 99.56% specificity and 95.00% sensitivity for patients tested 15 days after symptom onset.

The IgM test is now available on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity platforms.

— Filgotinib 200mg Achieved Endoscopic, Histologic and Six-Month Corticosteroid-Free Remission at Week 58 with a Consistent Safety Profile —

— Study Enrolled Biologic-Naïve and Biologic-Experienced Patients, a High Proportion of Whom Were Highly Refractory —

Foster City, Calif., & Mechelen, Belgium, October 12, 2020, 15.15 CET – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today presented late-breaking data demonstrating sustained efficacy and safety with filgotinib, an investigational, oral, once-daily, JAK1 preferential inhibitor, for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, versus placebo, achieved clinical remission at Week 10 and maintained remission through Week 58. In addition, significantly more patients achieved six-month corticosteroid-free remission. The full results were presented today at the 2020 United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Virtual Meeting (Abstracts #LB19 and #LB20).

UC is a longer-term condition characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum. An increasingly prevalent disease, UC has a significant impact on the quality of life of more than 2 million people around the world. Despite current treatments, many patients experience fecal urgency, incontinence, recurring bloody diarrhea, and the need to empty their bowels frequently, often accompanied by abdominal pain, poor sleep and fatigue.

“There remains a tremendous need for treatments that can achieve meaningful and sustained clinical outcomes in ulcerative colitis,” said Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, Gastroenterology Department at Lorraine University in France, and presenting investigator of the SELECTION maintenance study. “These study results showed that filgotinib reduced bleeding and stool frequency while also achieving remission across a range of measures, including endoscopy and histology, in an oral formulation.”

The SELECTION study included biologic-naïve patients, for whom prior conventional therapy had failed, as well as biologic-experienced patients, a high proportion of whom had been non-responders to at least two different lines of prior biologics. In total, 43 percent of patients in the biologic-experienced cohort had failed treatment with both a TNF inhibitor and vedolizumab. The study allowed the enrollment of patients who were taking steroids, and/or immunomodulators, including methotrexate, mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine, as they would in real-world clinical practice.

Efficacy Data of Filgotinib in Induction and Maintenance
Overall, 1,348 biologic-naïve or biologic-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized and treated in the SELECTION study. Among biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (26.1% vs. 15.3%, p=0.0157). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) remission (24.5% vs. 12.4%, p=0.0053), endoscopic remission (12.2% vs. 3.6%, p=0.0047) and histologic remission (35.1% vs. 16.1%, p<0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of biologic-experienced patients treated with filgotinib 200mg achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (11.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.0103).

Patients treated with filgotinib who achieved clinical response or remission at Week 10 were re-randomized to their induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58 (Maintenance Trial, n=558). At Week 58, 37.2 percent of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission, compared with 11.2 percent of patients treated with placebo (p˂0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of those treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (18.1% vs. 5.1%, p=0.0024), MCS remission (34.7% vs. 9.2%, p<0.0001), endoscopic remission (15.6% vs. 6.1%, p=0.0157) and histologic remission (38.2% vs. 13.3%, p<0.0001). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved six-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58 compared with placebo (27.2% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0055).

Safety Outcomes with Filgotinib in Ulcerative Colitis
Overall, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were similar in the filgotinib and placebo groups in both the induction and maintenance periods of the study. Serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal perforation were infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. The most common adverse events of interest in the induction trials were serious infections (1.1% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.2% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo), opportunistic infections (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and pulmonary embolism (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo). In the maintenance trial, the most common adverse events of interest were serious infections (1.7% filgotinib 100 mg, 1.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.5% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and venous thrombosis (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 2.2% placebo). Two deaths were observed in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group in the maintenance trial; both adverse events leading to deaths were considered by the study investigators to be unrelated to study drug.

“Ulcerative colitis is a complex and unpredictable condition that can impact people in the prime of their lives. Despite treatment, people with UC can experience symptoms that have a significant impact on their quality of life,” said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation, Gilead Sciences. “We are pleased to share these data on the use of filgotinib in UC as we work to identify new treatment options to address unmet needs across a range of inflammatory diseases.”

“The SELECTION study assessed the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in some of the most difficult-to-treat patients with ulcerative colitis, including a high proportion of patients who were refractory to biologic treatment and in need of new treatment options,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos. “The efficacy and safety data seen with filgotinib in this patient population add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential this once-daily treatment may offer patients living with this debilitating condition.”

About the SELECTION Phase 2b/3 Trial
The SELECTION Phase 2b/3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the JAK1 preferential inhibitor, filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The SELECTION trial comprises two induction trials and a maintenance trial. The Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients, and the Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients.

Across both induction studies, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a rectal bleeding score ≥ 1, a stool frequency score ≥ 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 based on the MCS. Patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.

The primary objectives of SELECTION were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 in the induction studies and Week 58 in the maintenance study. Eligible patients who were enrolled in the SELECTION trial were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC.

— Filgotinib 200mg Achieved Endoscopic, Histologic and Six-Month Corticosteroid-Free Remission at Week 58 with a Consistent Safety Profile —

— Study Enrolled Biologic-Naïve and Biologic-Experienced Patients, a High Proportion of Whom Were Highly Refractory —

Foster City, Calif., & Mechelen, Belgium, October 12, 2020, 15.15 CET – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today presented late-breaking data demonstrating sustained efficacy and safety with filgotinib, an investigational, oral, once-daily, JAK1 preferential inhibitor, for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, versus placebo, achieved clinical remission at Week 10 and maintained remission through Week 58. In addition, significantly more patients achieved six-month corticosteroid-free remission. The full results were presented today at the 2020 United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Virtual Meeting (Abstracts #LB19 and #LB20).

UC is a longer-term condition characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum. An increasingly prevalent disease, UC has a significant impact on the quality of life of more than 2 million people around the world. Despite current treatments, many patients experience fecal urgency, incontinence, recurring bloody diarrhea, and the need to empty their bowels frequently, often accompanied by abdominal pain, poor sleep and fatigue.

“There remains a tremendous need for treatments that can achieve meaningful and sustained clinical outcomes in ulcerative colitis,” said Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, Gastroenterology Department at Lorraine University in France, and presenting investigator of the SELECTION maintenance study. “These study results showed that filgotinib reduced bleeding and stool frequency while also achieving remission across a range of measures, including endoscopy and histology, in an oral formulation.”

The SELECTION study included biologic-naïve patients, for whom prior conventional therapy had failed, as well as biologic-experienced patients, a high proportion of whom had been non-responders to at least two different lines of prior biologics. In total, 43 percent of patients in the biologic-experienced cohort had failed treatment with both a TNF inhibitor and vedolizumab. The study allowed the enrollment of patients who were taking steroids, and/or immunomodulators, including methotrexate, mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine, as they would in real-world clinical practice.

Efficacy Data of Filgotinib in Induction and Maintenance
Overall, 1,348 biologic-naïve or biologic-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized and treated in the SELECTION study. Among biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (26.1% vs. 15.3%, p=0.0157). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of biologic-naïve patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) remission (24.5% vs. 12.4%, p=0.0053), endoscopic remission (12.2% vs. 3.6%, p=0.0047) and histologic remission (35.1% vs. 16.1%, p<0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of biologic-experienced patients treated with filgotinib 200mg achieved clinical remission at Week 10 compared with placebo (11.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.0103).

Patients treated with filgotinib who achieved clinical response or remission at Week 10 were re-randomized to their induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58 (Maintenance Trial, n=558). At Week 58, 37.2 percent of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission, compared with 11.2 percent of patients treated with placebo (p˂0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of those treated with filgotinib 200 mg versus placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (18.1% vs. 5.1%, p=0.0024), MCS remission (34.7% vs. 9.2%, p<0.0001), endoscopic remission (15.6% vs. 6.1%, p=0.0157) and histologic remission (38.2% vs. 13.3%, p<0.0001). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved six-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 58 compared with placebo (27.2% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0055).

Safety Outcomes with Filgotinib in Ulcerative Colitis
Overall, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were similar in the filgotinib and placebo groups in both the induction and maintenance periods of the study. Serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal perforation were infrequent and comparable across treatment groups. The most common adverse events of interest in the induction trials were serious infections (1.1% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.2% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.6% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo), opportunistic infections (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and pulmonary embolism (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.2% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo). In the maintenance trial, the most common adverse events of interest were serious infections (1.7% filgotinib 100 mg, 1.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 1.1% placebo), herpes zoster (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.5% filgotinib 200 mg, 0.0% placebo) and venous thrombosis (0.0% filgotinib 100 mg, 0.0% filgotinib 200 mg, 2.2% placebo). Two deaths were observed in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group in the maintenance trial; both adverse events leading to deaths were considered by the study investigators to be unrelated to study drug.

“Ulcerative colitis is a complex and unpredictable condition that can impact people in the prime of their lives. Despite treatment, people with UC can experience symptoms that have a significant impact on their quality of life,” said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation, Gilead Sciences. “We are pleased to share these data on the use of filgotinib in UC as we work to identify new treatment options to address unmet needs across a range of inflammatory diseases.”

“The SELECTION study assessed the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in some of the most difficult-to-treat patients with ulcerative colitis, including a high proportion of patients who were refractory to biologic treatment and in need of new treatment options,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos. “The efficacy and safety data seen with filgotinib in this patient population add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential this once-daily treatment may offer patients living with this debilitating condition.”

About the SELECTION Phase 2b/3 Trial
The SELECTION Phase 2b/3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the JAK1 preferential inhibitor, filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. The SELECTION trial comprises two induction trials and a maintenance trial. The Induction Study A enrolled biologic-naïve patients, and the Induction Study B enrolled biologic-experienced patients.

Across both induction studies, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a rectal bleeding score ≥ 1, a stool frequency score ≥ 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 based on the MCS. Patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.

The primary objectives of SELECTION were to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing clinical remission as determined by the Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1-point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 in the induction studies and Week 58 in the maintenance study. Eligible patients who were enrolled in the SELECTION trial were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC.

In combination with other COVID-19 diagnostic tests, the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test can help in the management of patients for optimal care delivery
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it intends to launch a high-volume SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test as an aid in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The test is planned to be made available at the end of 2020 for markets accepting the CE Mark. Roche also intends to file for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Elecsys® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is a highly accurate laboratory immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The test is performed by healthcare professionals and uses nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples from patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, or people with either known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen immunoassay runs on all cobas e immunochemistry analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide test results in 18 minutes for a single test (excluding time for sample collection, transport, and preparation), with a throughput of up to 300 tests per hour from a single analyser, depending on the analyser.1 A laboratory based automated antigen assay allows for cost and error reduction due to removal of manual handling as well as fast turn-around times and high test throughput.

Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics, stated, “We are aware that governments and healthcare systems are under intense pressure to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity to effectively manage the spread of the virus. A high-volume antigen test is a valuable addition to the testing portfolio for helping diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Being able to quickly and correctly identify if someone has a SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to informing patient management decisions and containing the spread of COVID-19. Roche remains committed to supporting governments, healthcare professionals and patients to fight this pandemic with the help of our diagnostics solutions.”

The test will be another addition to the comprehensive Roche diagnostic portfolio of solutions to help healthcare systems combat COVID-19 through testing in the laboratory and at the point of care. These solutions include both tests to detect an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and tests measuring the body’s immune response upon infection or vaccination. The following table provides an overview of Roche’s current COVID-19 test portfolio for the detection of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response:

For more information, please also refer to the following infographic: 3 Factors that decide on the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 Test.

About the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test
Roche’s Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection of a specific antigen of SARS-CoV-2 present in the respiratory tract including nasopharynx and oropharynx. The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is performed by healthcare professionals and could be used as an alternative or in conjunction with PCR testing. This is highly beneficial where reliable laboratory PCR testing is not available or where there are challenges in testing capacity. A positive result with the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test most likely indicates an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. A negative result may require to be confirmed with a PCR test or repeated (antigen test) after one to two days, if other clinical indications point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Performance evaluations around sensitivity and specificity of the test are ongoing and will be shared at the time of launch.

About antigen testing
An antigen test detects proteins which are structural or functional components of a pathogen and are thus very specific to that pathogen.2 In this case, the test would provide a qualitative “yes/no” answer on the presence of the pathogen in the patient sample. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies and generate a positive result.3

In general, antigen tests have a high specificity, though are not as sensitive as PCR tests that amplify the target viral DNA or RNA sequence in order to generate a quantifiable signal to indicate the presence of the virus in a sample. Therefore, to make up for the potential decrease in sensitivity of an antigen test, negative results should be analysed together with additional patient factors, such as COVID-19 exposure history, clinical symptoms, additional test results to help guide the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of the patient.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to manage, detect and diagnose current and/or previous infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems. We continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

Our diagnostics solutions:

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:

a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)
a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based qualitative antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid protein (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic
a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test to help determine at the point of care whether a person has been exposed to the virus (CE Mark)
a rapid antigen test to support in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care within 15 minutes (CE Mark)
a high-volume molecular test to simultaneously detect and differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, as the symptoms are similar for both (FDA EUA and CE Mark)
a second SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, aimed at measuring the spike protein to support vaccination development and complement our existing portfolio (CE Mark)
Our research into therapies:

Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.

Specifically, on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.

Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.

Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

50298,J&amp;J Pauses Dosing in COVID-19 Vaccine Studies Due to Unexplained Illness,Johnson & Johnson Temporarily Pauses All Dosing in Our Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Clinical Trials,"J&J temporarily pauses the further dosing in all clinical studies of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735, including the P-III ENSEMBLE trial, due to an “unexplained illness” in one participant
 Following the guidelines, the subject’s illness is being reviewed and evaluated by the ENSEMBLE independent DSMB, as well as its own internal clinical and safety physicians. J&J reported that all clinical studies it conducts have prespecified guidelines allowing them to pause if an unexpected SAEs occurred
 The pause of the ENSEMBLE study comes just over a month after AstraZeneca confirmed that its P-III study was put on hold due to a possible safety issue. J&J had started the ENSEMBLE study last month to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single vaccine dose in preventing COVID-19","At Johnson & Johnson, there is no greater priority than the safety and well being of the people we serve every day around the world. We are committed to providing transparent updates throughout the clinical development process of our vaccine candidate, in compliance with regulatory standards and our own high ethical and scientific principles.

We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant. Following our guidelines, the participant’s illness is being reviewed and evaluated by the ENSEMBLE independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as well as our internal clinical and safety physicians.

Adverse events – illnesses, accidents, etc. – even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies. Based on our strong commitment to safety, all clinical studies conducted by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson have prespecified guidelines. These ensure our studies may be paused if an unexpected serious adverse event (SAE) that might be related to a vaccine or study drug is reported, so there can be a careful review of all of the medical information before deciding whether to restart the study.

We must respect this participant’s privacy. We’re also learning more about this participant’s illness, and it’s important to have all the facts before we share additional information.

SAEs are not uncommon in clinical trials, and the number of SAEs can reasonably be expected to increase in trials involving large numbers of participants. Further, as many trials are placebo-controlled, it is not always immediately apparent whether a participant received a study treatment or a placebo.

“Study Pause” vs. “Regulatory Hold:” What’s the Difference?

While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there is a significant distinction between a study pause and a regulatory hold of a clinical trial.

A study pause, in which recruitment or dosing is paused by the study sponsor, is a standard component of a clinical trial protocol. As noted in the ENSEMBLE study protocol, Johnson & Johnson has robust mechanisms in place to protect the safety of participants in its clinical trials. While the Company informs all study investigators, we typically do not communicate study pauses publicly.
A regulatory hold of a clinical trial is a requirement by a regulatory health authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As outlined in our transparency commitments, we proactively disclose any regulatory hold of a pivotal clinical trial.

 The initiation of the study follows the identification of the RP2D in the ongoing study of LNS8801. The company anticipates opening several more phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts exploring LNS8801 activity as a monothx. and in combination with other compounds in 2021
 LNS8801 (PO) is a bioavailable small molecule that is a highly specific and potent agonist of the GPER and has demonstrated target engagement and clinical benefit in advanced cancer patients. P-l/ll study’s results are anticipated to be presented in a peer-reviewed setting in 2021","HADDONFIELD, N.J., Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Linnaeus Therapeutics, Inc. (Linnaeus), a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule oncology therapeutics, today announced that it has dosed the first patient in its phase 1/2 adaptive-design clinical trial of its lead-product-candidate, LNS8801, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients who had previous clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and then subsequently progressed. This marks the first time any company has dosed a patient in a clinical trial specifically targeting the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in combination with pembrolizumab. The initiation of the study follows the successful identification of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in the Company’s ongoing study of LNS8801.

LNS8801 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is a highly specific and potent agonist of the GPER. LNS8801 is currently finishing the dose escalation portion of its phase 1/2 study assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced cancer.

“We are extremely pleased to begin testing LNS8801 in combination with pembrolizumab in this patient population. In our phase 1 trial of LNS8801 we have seen biological and clinical signals that suggest LNS8801 in combination with pembrolizumab may have activity based on the preclinical rationale and reverse resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  We currently have six outstanding academic comprehensive cancer centers all enthusiastically recruiting patients for this promising study,” commented Patrick Mooney, MD, chief executive officer of Linnaeus. “We believe that LNS8801 with pembrolizumab has potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit for patients with cancer, and we look forward to providing updates over the course of the study.”

The study entitled, “A Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of LNS8801 in Patients with Advanced Cancer Including Immunotherapy Refractory Expansion Cohorts with and without Pembrolizumab,” was designed in two parts. The phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of LNS8801.  Data from the study has allowed Linnaeus to determine the RP2D and safely open the phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts.  Linnaeus anticipates opening several more phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts exploring LNS8801 activity as a monotherapy and in combination with other compounds in defined patient populations in the coming year.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

About LNS8801
LNS8801 is an orally bioavailable and highly specific agonist of GPER whose activity is dependent on the expression of GPER. GPER activation suppresses well-known tumor-associated genes, such as c-Myc and PD-L1. In preclinical cancer models, LNS8801 displays potent antitumor activities across a wide range of tumor types, rapidly shrinking tumors and inducing immune memory.

In the ongoing phase 1/2 study in humans, LNS8801 monotherapy has been safe and well-tolerated. Additionally, LNS8801 has demonstrated target engagement and clinical benefit in advanced cancer patients.  Data from the phase 1/2 study is anticipated to be presented in a peer-reviewed setting in 2021.

About COVID-191,2

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that lead to illnesses from the common cold to severe diseases. Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the disease COVID-19, this new strain, discovered in 2019, is behind the ongoing pandemic outbreak.

The most common signs of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough and tiredness; however, people may also experience other symptoms including shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Most people infected with the virus will exhibit mild to moderate symptoms however older people, and those with existing underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more likely to develop a more severe form of COVID-19.

Please find up to date information about the outbreak via the World Health Organization at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1

About CT-P59

CT-P59 was identified as a potential treatment for COVID-19 through screening of antibody candidates and selecting those that showed the highest potency in neutralising the SARS-CoV-2 virus including the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant). In pre-clinical data the treatment candidate demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, as well as a reduction in lung inflammation.3

50325,Moderna Initiates Rolling Submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273 Against COVID-19,Moderna Announces Initiation of Rolling Submission to Health Canada for mRNA Vaccine Against COVID-19 (mRNA-1273),"The initiation of a rolling submission follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the +ve interim analysis of the P-l study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (aged 18-55 yrs.) and older adults (aged 56-70 and 71+), published in the NEJM
 Moderna has become the third maker that initiates the rolling submission to Health Canada for speeding up the approval. Health Canada is already conducting real-time reviews of BioNTech & Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidates along with AstraZeneca’s candidate
 The rolling reviews speed up the process of approving a vaccine, allowing researchers to submit findings in real-time, without having to wait for studies to conclude","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Oct. 13, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This initiation follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the positive interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (ages 18-55 years) and older adults (ages 56-70 and 71+) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The rolling submission has been accepted under the Canadian Minister of Health’s Interim Order, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data and information as they become available. This rolling review process allows Health Canada to begin its assessment using the information submitted by the applicant and accept new evidence as it becomes available until the application is deemed complete. This process can reduce time to authorization for these important new drugs while maintaining appropriate standards of safety, efficacy, and quality. Health Canada will not make a decision to authorize any vaccine being considered under rolling review until it has received all necessary evidence to support its safety and efficacy. Following the authorization of any vaccine submission, Health Canada will publish the evidence used in making its decision for transparency.

On September 22, the Canadian Government increased its confirmed order commitment to 20 million doses of mRNA-1273. Moderna remains on track to be able to deliver up to 56 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to help protect Canadians beginning in 2021. The Canadian vaccine supply will be sourced from Moderna’s European production capacity with its strategic manufacturing partner Lonza of Switzerland, and ROVI of Spain for fill-finish services.

“We are pleased with the interactions with the Canadian regulatory authorities and we appreciate their guidance and confidence in Moderna to pursue a rolling submission in Canada for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to developing a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies around the world and we will continue working closely with Health Canada.”

The Phase 1 interim analysis showed that mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated across all age groups and induced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In the 18-55 age group, neutralizing antibody titers were observed in 100% of evaluated participants and at the 100 µg dose level selected for Phase 3, the geometric mean titers were above those seen in convalescent sera. Similarly, mRNA-1273 induced consistently high levels of pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers in all participants in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups. In addition, vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited Th1-biased CD4 T cell responses in all age groups.

mRNA-1273 is currently being studied in a Phase 3 randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial of 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U.S. As of Friday, October 9, the Phase 3 COVE study has enrolled approximately 28,618 participants with 22,194 having received their second vaccination. The clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT04470427. For more information about the Phase 3 COVE study, click here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. Across Moderna’s pipeline, more than 30,000 healthy volunteers and patients have been enrolled in Moderna’s clinical studies, including the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has seven development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for eight prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV, Zika and COVID-19). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

50339,Boehringer Ingelheim Presents Results of Gilotrif (afatinib) for NSCLC at IASLC NACLC 2020,"IASLC NACLC 2020: Boehringer Ingelheim presents new data for Gilotrif® in metastatic, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC","Real-world study shows the effectiveness and safety of 2L Gilotrif following 1L IO plus CT in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
 Results: Median overall TOT for patients who received 2L afatinib & CT (7.3mos. & 4.2mos.); the incidence of irAEs occurred in 6 patients while no reported irAES in the chemotherapy cohort.
 Separate data presented indicate Gilotrif activity in TKI-naïve patients with G719X/L861Q/S768I non-resistant EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Gilotrif is indicated for metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have non-resistant EGFR mutations and for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressed after treatment with platinum-based CT","RIDGEFIELD, Conn., Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boehringer Ingelheim today announced new data for Gilotrif® (afatinib) which further affirm its activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and, in a separate study, epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFR M+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The findings are being presented at the IASLC 2020 North America Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (NACLC 2020).

Analysis from a retrospective, real-world study of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who progressed on first-line pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy provides effectiveness and safety data for afatinib following immunotherapy (IO) in this second-line setting. Median overall time on treatment (TOT) for patients who received second-line afatinib was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]; 5.2-8.1). Incidence of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in six patients (pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis). This analysis also evaluated chemotherapy in this second-line setting, with median overall TOT of 4.2 months (95% CI; 3.9-4.9). There were no reported irAES in the chemotherapy cohort.

“Given relatively recent advances with immunotherapy, prospective trials have yet to investigate the use of afatinib following first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy in metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer,” said Edward S. Kim, M.D., FACP, Levine Cancer Institute. “Findings from this study suggest that second-line afatinib is generally well-tolerated and effective in patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung when pembrolizumab is added to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.”

In a separate data set presented at the meeting, researchers assessed the use of afatinib in Asian and non-Asian patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC whose tumors have G719X/L861Q/S768I non-resistant mutations, pooled from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. The analysis showed that afatinib is effective in these patients, and is unaffected by ethnicity (overall response rate: 66% Asian/59% non-Asian; median duration of response: 14.7 months/15.9 months; G719X: 62%/65%; L861Q: 60%/50%; S768I: 80%/25%).

Bjoern Rueter, M.D., Therapeutic Area Head Oncology, USA, at Boehringer Ingelheim, said, “These data sets further expand our understanding of afatinib’s therapeutic profile in metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer and among those with EGFR mutation-positive disease. As we continue to take cancer on at Boehringer Ingelheim, our ongoing research is aimed at supporting unmet treatment needs for the lung cancer and broader oncology community through leading science.”

Gilotrif is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have non-resistant EGFR mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. Gilotrif is also approved for the treatment of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung whose disease has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.

 Dyno will be responsible for the design of novel AAV capsids with improved functional properties for gene therapy while Roche and Spark will conduct preclinical, clinical, and commercialization activities for the products using the novel capsids
 The collaboration leverages Dyno’s CapsidMap platform for the development of next-generation AAV vectors for CNS diseases and liver-directed therapies for the portfolio of both Roche and Spark","Cambridge, MA – October 14, 2020 – Dyno Therapeutics, a biotech company applying artificial intelligence (AI) to gene therapy, today announced a collaboration and license agreement with Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) to apply Dyno’s CapsidMap™ platform for the development of next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for gene therapies for central nervous system (CNS) diseases and liver-directed therapies for the portfolio of both Roche and Spark Therapeutics, a member of the Roche Group.

Dyno’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform represents a transformative approach to the identification of novel AAV capsids – the cell-targeting protein shell of viral vectors – optimizing tissue targeting and immune-evading properties, in addition to improving packaging capacity and manufacturability.

Under the terms of the agreement, Dyno will be responsible for the design of novel AAV capsids with improved functional properties for gene therapy, while Roche and Spark Therapeutics will be responsible for conducting preclinical, clinical and commercialization activities for gene therapy product candidates using the novel capsids. Dyno will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and if successful, is eligible to receive additional payments during the research phase of the collaboration as well as clinical and sales milestone payments and royalties for any resulting products. The aggregate potential value of future milestone payments to Dyno may exceed $1.8 billion.

“This new partnership represents Dyno’s largest collaboration to date, and we are excited to work with Roche and Spark Therapeutics to expand the frontier of gene therapies for the central nervous system and liver. The Dyno, Roche and Spark teams share a bold vision for gene therapy and believe that enhancing vectors that deliver these therapies is key to developing new treatments for patients in need,” stated Dyno’s CEO and co-founder Eric Kelsic, Ph.D. “Partnering is a fundamental element of Dyno’s business strategy, and the continuing interest by leading gene therapy developers is accelerating our growth plans and positive impact on patients.”

“We strongly believe in the potential of gene therapy and are excited to bring together experts from Roche, Spark and Dyno to develop next-generation gene therapies. Dyno’s innovative AI-powered approach to designing optimized AAV vectors will further complement and build on our progress in gene therapy. We look forward to leveraging Dyno’s technology to develop new, innovative treatments for patients across CNS and liver-directed therapies,” said James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering.

About CapsidMap™ for Designing AAV Gene Therapies

By designing capsids that confer improved functional properties to Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors, Dyno’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform overcomes the limitations of today’s gene therapies on the market and in development. Today’s treatments are primarily confined to a small number of naturally occurring AAV vectors that are limited by delivery, immunity, packaging size, and manufacturing challenges. CapsidMap uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology for the design of novel capsids, the cell-targeting protein shell of viral vectors. The CapsidMap platform applies leading-edge DNA library synthesis and next generation DNA sequencing to measure in vivo gene delivery properties in high throughput. At the core of CapsidMap are advanced search algorithms leveraging machine learning and Dyno’s massive quantities of experimental data, that together build a comprehensive map of sequence space and thereby accelerate the discovery and optimization of synthetic AAV capsids.

About Dyno Therapeutics

Dyno Therapeutics is a pioneer in applying artificial intelligence (AI) and quantitative high-throughput in vivo experiments to gene therapy. The company’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform rapidly discovers and systematically optimizes Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsid vectors that significantly outperform current approaches for in vivo gene delivery, thereby expanding the range of diseases treatable with gene therapies. Dyno was founded in 2018 by experienced biotech entrepreneurs and leading scientists in the fields of gene therapy and machine learning. The company is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

50363,"Regeneron's Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Treatment for Ebola",Regeneron’s Antibody Cocktail REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb®) is First FDA-Approved Treatment for Ebola (Zaire Ebolavirus),"The approval is based on the PALM trial assessing Inmazeb vs Zmapp and remdesivir in 681 adult and pediatric patients including newborns of mothers who have tested positive for the infection. The study demonstrated 1EPs of mortality @28days (33.5% vs 51.3%) and 2EPs of reduction in days until the virus was undetectable in the bloodstream
 As per the agreement signed in Jul’2020, Regeneron will deliver a number of Inmazeb treatment doses for 6yrs. to the BARDA.
 Inmazeb is a triple antibody cocktail consisting of 3 mAbs (atoltivimab, maftivimab & odesivimab, 50 mg each /kg) that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes on Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein","In a large clinical trial, Inmazeb showed superiority compared to other investigational agents (ZMapp and remdesivir) with respect to mortality; treatment was most effective when given early in the course of disease1

Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) is a novel anti-viral antibody medicine developed using the same ‘rapid response’ technologies as Regeneron’s investigational COVID-19 antibody combination

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including newborns of mothers who have tested positive for the infection.

“We are incredibly proud that the FDA has approved Inmazeb, which is also known as REGN-EB3. This is the first time the FDA has approved a treatment specifically for Ebola, which has caused a number of deadly outbreaks,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Decades of investment in our VelociSuite® rapid response technologies, the dedication of world-class scientists, and the courageous contributions of healthcare providers and patients, together with remarkable cooperation between leading international health organizations and governments, have led to this important moment. As we apply the same sophisticated technologies and manufacturing capabilities against COVID-19, we hope this will be one of many demonstrations of how the power of science can be successfully deployed against dangerous infectious diseases.”

As part of an agreement announced in July 2020, Regeneron will deliver an established number of Inmazeb treatment doses over the course of six years to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) goal of building national preparedness for public health emergencies.

In keeping with our mission and values, Regeneron is committed to making this important medicine available to the people who need it. In response to the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), we worked with the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. FDA and other global organizations to offer Inmazeb under a compassionate use protocol and include it in the four-arm PALM (PAmoja TuLinde Maisha) Trial. With BARDA support, we continue to provide Inmazeb for free in response to outbreaks in the DRC through the MEURI protocol for compassionate use. Regeneron is actively working with non-governmental organizations and public health agencies to ensure continued access to Inmazeb in low- and middle-income countries.

“Since 2015, BARDA has partnered with Regeneron to develop a life-saving treatment for Ebola Zaire. The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Inmazeb shows the power of public private partnerships to bring forward these critical treatments and improve global public health,” said Gary Disbrow, the Acting Director of BARDA. “BARDA is continuing our collaboration with Regeneron on other life-threatening diseases such as MERS and COVID-19, and we look forward to continued success.”

The safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was established through the 681-patient PALM Trial, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial initiated in 2018 in the DRC. The WHO, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in the DRC jointly sponsored and served as co-principal investigators of the trial. In 2019, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the PALM Trial was stopped early following a pre-specified interim analysis that showed superiority of Inmazeb to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. Adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of Inmazeb patients were chills, elevation in fever (pyrexia), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), rapid breathing (tachypnea), vomiting, low blood pressure (hypotension), diarrhea and inadequate oxygen supply to the tissue (hypoxia); of these, only chills occurred more frequently with Inmazeb than ZMapp. The evaluation of AEs in Inmazeb patients may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection.

About Inmazeb
Inmazeb, previously called REGN-EB3, was created using Regeneron’s VelocImmune® platform and associated VelociSuite® technologies. The treatment consists of three monoclonal antibodies of similar structure, atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab, that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes on Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. The three antibodies help neutralize the Ebola virus by blocking its ability to invade patients’ and/or enlisting other immune cells to target infected cells and remove them from the body.

Inmazeb is administered as a single, weight-based intravenous infusion (50 mg atoltivimab, 50 mg maftivimab and 50 mg odesivimab per kg). Inmazeb was developed in collaboration and with federal funds from BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the HHS under ongoing USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C.

INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

INDICATION
INMAZEB is indicated for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus infection.

Limitations of Use: The efficacy of INMAZEB has not been established for other species of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera. Zaire ebolavirus can change over time, and factors such as emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating Zaire ebolavirus strains when deciding to use INMAZEB.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion-Associated Events: Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion-associated events have been reported during and post-infusion with INMAZEB. These may include acute, life-threatening reactions during and after the infusion. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms including, but not limited to, hypotension, chills and elevation of fever, during and following INMAZEB infusion. In the case of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue the administration of INMAZEB immediately and administer appropriate emergency care.

Infusion could not be completed in 1% of subjects who received INMAZEB due to infusion-associated adverse events. The rate of infusion of INMAZEB may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:

The most common adverse events reported in at least 10% of subjects who received INMAZEB were pyrexia (or elevation in fever), chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, vomiting, hypotension, diarrhea and hypoxia. The evaluation of adverse events in subjects who received INMAZEB may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection.
Selected grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities for INMAZEB included high sodium (≥ 154 mmol/L), low sodium (<125 mmol/L), high potassium (≥ 6.5 mmol/L), low potassium (< 2.5 mmol/L), creatinine ((mg/dL) ≥ 1.8 x ULN), high alanine aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN) and high aspartate aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN).
DRUG INTERACTIONS: INMAZEB may reduce the efficacy of live vaccine therefore, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with INMAZEB. The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines.

50375,Takeda Collaborates with Accenture and AWS to Transform into a Cloud-Based Company,Takeda Accelerates Digital Transformation with Accenture and AWS,"Takeda has entered into a five-year agreement with Accenture and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support the company in moving 80% of its applications to the cloud and modernizing its research tools
 The transition of Takeda’s applications to the cloud will enable the company to remove non-differentiating technology and create a scalable architecture. The collaboration will leverage cloud and data-driven insights to accelerate drug development, increase operational agility, reduce technology costs, and develop the workforce of the future
 Additionally, the collaboration with Accenture and AWS has already helped the Takeda to use the cloud in launching a clinical trial acceleration and secure data-sharing platform for the COVID R&D Alliance in <5days. The COVID R&D Alliance is a consortium comprising 20 companies, including Takeda, Amgen, and AbbVie to study and identify the potential of COVID-19 therapies","Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK) (“Takeda”), Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) have entered into a five-year strategic agreement to accelerate Takeda’s digital transformation.

Not only will patients benefit from Takeda’s ability to respond with greater speed, agility, and insights across the value chain, but customers, employees, and partners will also benefit. This long-term collaboration will fuel Takeda’s cloud-driven business transformation by modernizing platforms, accelerating data services, establishing an internal engine for innovation, and equipping Takeda’s employees with new skills and ways of working.

“By combining the power of three organizations, Takeda is making a bold move to be at the intersection of human health, technology and business growth,” said Christophe Weber, Takeda president and chief executive officer. “My vision is that, in less than ten years, every Takeda employee will be empowered by an artificial intelligence assistant to help make better decisions, enabling us to deliver transformative therapies and better experiences to patients, physicians and payers faster than previously possible. Together, Accenture and AWS will propel Takeda further than we could alone to make this vision a reality.”

Taking a cloud-first technology approach will create a more scalable, reliable and secure architecture and eliminate unnecessary integration activities. By moving 80% of applications to the cloud, Takeda will remove non-differentiating technology, reduce its internal data center footprint, and decrease capital expenditures.

“By leveraging the most comprehensive set of cloud services in the industry, innovators like Takeda can cut costs, time to insight and discovery, and improve patient experiences,” said Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of AWS. “The breadth and depth of AWS services enable Takeda to quickly and efficiently discover, develop, and manufacture therapeutics securely and compliantly. We’re excited to continue our work with Takeda as they innovate to deliver accessible and promising new therapies to save lives.”

Accelerating the delivery of data services and capabilities will help Takeda increase connectivity and collaboration with the life sciences ecosystem and external partners. For example, the collaboration has already helped Takeda harness the cloud to launch, in less than five days, a secure data sharing and clinical trial acceleration platform for the COVID R&D Alliance. Without the cloud, launching the platform would have taken up to three months.

In addition, the Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, which develops critical, life-saving and life-sustaining therapies for patients with rare and complex diseases, is creating state-of-the-art, digitally-connected donation centers and modernizing the donor experience, optimizing the plasma collection process. Takeda’s plans to increase its plasma collection and manufacturing capacity by at least 65% by 2024 are geared towards expanding access to essential medicines and accelerating new treatments for patients.

“Takeda’s bold move to become a cloud first company, 80% in the cloud, is a powerful example of how transformation benefits all – from accelerating therapies for patients, to empowering employees with new ways of working, creating new jobs, and upskilling people for the digital world, to the sustainability benefits of moving to the public cloud. We are proud to partner with Takeda and AWS to make this vision a reality at speed and scale,” said Julie Sweet, chief executive officer, Accenture.

Over the next three years, Takeda anticipates creating hundreds of new jobs in specialized roles in emerging data and digital fields, accessing new talent pools, and upskilling thousands of employees to propel its data and digital capabilities.

 Aliqopa is a PI3K inhibitor with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells and is an approved treatment for patients with relapsed FL prior treated with two systemic therapies","Phase III study CHRONOS-3 in patients with relapsed indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (iNHL) who have received one or more prior lines of rituximab-containing therapy meets primary endpoint of progression-free survival
Safety observed in the trial was generally consistent with previously published data on the individual components of the combination and no new safety signals were identified
October 14, 2020 02:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
WHIPPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bayer announced today that the Phase III study CHRONOS-3 evaluating Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) in combination with rituximab in indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (iNHL) patients (n=458) who have relapsed after one or more prior lines of rituximab-containing therapy has met its primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). The study predominantly included patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma, as well as patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia. In 2017, based on the Phase II CHRONOS-1 study, Aliqopa was approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

CHRONOS-3 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the objective to evaluate whether Aliqopa in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo plus rituximab in extending PFS in patients with relapsed iNHL following at least one prior rituximab product. The safety observed in the trial was generally consistent with previously published data on the individual components of the combination and no new safety signals were identified.

“Indolent forms of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma are a heterogenous group of malignancies characterized by a chronic pattern of remissions and recurrences. For iNHL patients with disease progression who are in need of treatment, there are few approved treatment options,” said Dr. Scott Z. Fields, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer. “The positive results from CHRONOS-3 demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of copanlisib in combination with rituximab, to address the unmet medical need in these patients.”

Results from CHRONOS-3 will be presented at a scientific congress. Bayer plans to discuss the data from CHRONOS-3 with health authorities worldwide.

Aliqopa is an intravenous phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with predominant activity against alpha and delta isoforms the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells.i Aliqopa is approved in the U.S. under the accelerated approval pathway for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on an ORR of 59% (n=61) 95% CI: 49, 68, including 14% (15/104) of complete responses (CRs) from the open-label, single-arm multicenter, Phase II clinical trial (CHRONOS-1), in a total of 142 subjects, which included 104 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed disease following at least two prior treatments. In the updated two-year follow-up analysis, Aliqopa ORR was 59% (n=61) 95% CI: 49, 68, including 20% CR (n=21).ii Tumor response was assessed according to the International Working Group response criteria for malignant lymphoma. Efficacy based on ORR was assessed by an Independent Review Committee. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

About CHRONOS-3

CHRONOS-3 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Aliqopa in combination with rituximab versus placebo in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent NHL who have received at least one or more lines of prior rituximab-containing treatment. Histological subtypes included in the trial were follicular lymphoma (FL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Patients must have relapsed after the last rituximab- containing therapy and either had a treatment-free interval of ≥ 12 months after completion of the last rituximab-containing treatment, or are unwilling to receive chemotherapy or for whom chemotherapy is contraindicated on reason of age, comorbidities, and/or residual toxicity (NCT02367040). The study enrolled 458 participants.

About Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of chronic diseases with poor prognosis. NHL is the most common hematologic malignancy and the tenth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 510,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. It accounts for nearly 249,000 deaths worldwide in 2018.

Indolent NHL consists of multiple subtypes, including follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM). While the disease is typically slowly growing, it can become more aggressive over time. Despite treatment advances, there remains a need for improved treatment options for the relapsed or refractory stage of the disease. After response to initial therapy, response rates and duration of response decline with subsequent lines of therapy, underscoring the need for patients whose disease has already progressed.

About Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) Injection

Aliqopa (copanlisib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

Aliqopa is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Aliqopa has been shown to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Aliqopa inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling, CXCR12 mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NFκB signaling in lymphoma cell lines.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Infections: Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection.

Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP prophylaxis for populations at risk. Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with concomitant PJP prophylaxis.

Hyperglycemia: Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 155 patients with baseline HbA1c <5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c >6.5% at the end of treatment.

Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely.

Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.

Hypertension: Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hypertensive events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg, respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension.

Non-infectious Pneumonitis: Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis.

Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious neutropenic events occurred in 1.3%. Monitor blood counts at least weekly during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.

Severe Cutaneous Reaction: Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy respectively. Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m2/day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.

Adverse Drug Reactions: Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥20%) in ALIQOPA-treated patients were: hyperglycemia (54%), leukopenia (36%), diarrhea (36%), decreased general strength and energy (36%), hypertension (35%), neutropenia (32%), nausea (26%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and lower respiratory tract infections (21%).

Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers. Reduce the ALIQOPA dose to 45 mg when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

For important risk and use information about Aliqopa, please see the full Prescribing Information.

About Detectnet

IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

 

Radiation Risk

Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including Detectnet, contribute to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

 

Risk for Image Misinterpretation

The uptake of copper Cu 64 dotatate reflects the level of somatostatin receptor density in NETs, however, uptake can also be seen in a variety of other tumors that also express somatostatin receptors. Increased uptake might also be seen in other non-cancerous pathologic conditions that express somatostatin receptors including thyroid disease or in subacute inflammation, or might occur as a normal physiologic variant (e.g. uncinate process of the pancreas).

 

A negative scan after the administration of Detectnet in patients who do not have a history of NET disease does not rule out disease.

 

ADVERSE REACTIONS

 

In clinical trials, adverse reactions occurred at a rate of < 2% and included nausea, vomiting and flushing.  In published trials nausea immediately after injection was observed.

 

DRUG INTERACTIONS

 

Somatostatin Analogs

Non-radioactive somatostatin analogs and copper Cu 64 dotatate competitively bind to somatostatin receptors (SSTR2). Image patients just prior to dosing with somatostatin analogs. For patients on long-acting somatostatin analogs, a wash-out period of 28 days is recommended prior to imaging. For patients on short-acting somatostatin analogs, a washout period of 2 days is recommended prior to imaging.

 

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

 

Pregnancy

All radiopharmaceuticals, including Detectnet, have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risks of fetal exposure to radiation from administration of Detectnet.

 

Lactation

Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding for 12 hours after Detectnet administration in order to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfed infant.

 

Pediatric use

The safety and effectiveness of Detectnet have not been established in pediatric patients.

 

Geriatric use

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

 

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding. A diuretic might also be considered.

About Neuroendocrine Tumors

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These neoplasms occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and liver, but can also occur in other tissues including lung, thymus and other uncommon sites such as cervix, heart and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).

 Qdolo is indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. It will be available at chain, independent, and specialty pharmacies","ATHENS, Ga., Sept. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Athena Bioscience, LLC, a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved QDOLO™ (tramadol hydrochloride) Oral Solution 5mg/1mL C-IV, an opioid agonist indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 50 million adults in the United States have chronic daily pain, with 19.6 million adults experiencing high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life or work activities. A May, 2019 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report on pain management best practices emphasized the need for an “individualized, patient-centered” approach for the treatment of pain.1

“As an oral liquid, QDOLO gives physicians flexibility to titrate dosing precisely according to individual patients’ needs,” said Jeff Bryant, President and CEO of Athena Bioscience. “In addition, for patients with swallowing disfunction (dysphagia) or who simply have trouble swallowing pills, QDOLO provides an essential alternative to other forms of tramadol.” QDOLO has a patent pending.

QDOLO (NDC: 71511-301-16) will be available at chain, independent, and specialty pharmacies.

INDICATION
QDOLO is indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve QDOLO for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics):

Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated.
Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering QDOLO to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed.
When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.
Instruct patients on how to measure and take the correct dose of QDOLO and to use extreme caution when measuring the dose.
Strongly advise patients to always use a calibrated oral syringe or other oral dosing device, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication.
Inform patients that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure QDOLO.
Do not use QDOLO concomitantly with other tramadol-containing products.
Do not administer QDOLO at a dose exceeding 400 mg (80 mL) per day.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.
Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.
Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with QDOLO and adjust the dosage accordingly.

 Eton expects Alkindi Sprinkle to be commercially available in the Q4’ 2020 and it will be available in four strengths: 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 5mg, to give greater dosing flexibility to clinicians
 Alkindi Sprinkle is the 1st and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for the treatment of adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for use in children","-ALKINDI SPRINKLE is the first and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for children

-Eton expects ALKINDI SPRINKLE to be available in the fourth quarter of 2020

DEER PARK, Ill., Sept. 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Nasdaq: ETON), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative treatments for rare pediatric diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ALKINDI® SPRINKLE (hydrocortisone) oral granules as replacement therapy for Adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) in children under 17 years of age. ALKINDI SPRINKLE is the first and only FDA-approved granular hydrocortisone formulation for the treatment of adrenocortical insufficiency specifically designed for use in children.

“The FDA approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE is a breakthrough for patients and caregivers treating pediatric adrenocortical insufficiency. We are excited to offer an FDA-approved product that enables low dosing and administration of hydrocortisone to pediatric patients,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to making the product available to patients in the coming months.”

“For years, we heard from parents about their struggle to provide the right dose to their child,” said Dina M. Matos, Executive Director of the CARES Foundation. “We are thrilled the FDA has approved ALKINDI SPRINKLE for pediatric patients with Adrenocortical Insufficiency including patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a type of Adrenocortical Insufficiency.”

The FDA approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE was supported by six clinical studies, including the first and only interventional Phase III study of oral hydrocortisone for Pediatric AI in neonates to children under eight years of age. Prior to the approval of ALKINDI SPRINKLE, oral hydrocortisone was only FDA-approved in tablet formulations of 5mg and stronger. Many pediatric patients require significantly lower doses and the flexibility of precision titration. ALKINDI SPRINKLE will be available in 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 5mg strengths, allowing clinicians greater flexibility to individualize dosing based on each patient’s needs in accordance with the instructions for dosage and administration.

Eton expects ALKINDI SPRINKLE to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2020.

About Pediatric Adrenocortical Insufficiency
Pediatric adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) is a rare disease characterized by an inability to synthesize and release cortisol, and sometimes aldosterone. This causes excessive androgens (abnormal sexual development in females, premature puberty, premature growth termination and short stature). The most common form of pediatric AI is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a genetic defect. Patients with primary or central (secondary and tertiary) AI lack appropriate levels of cortisol in their system. Diminished cortisol in the system may result in deadly consequences like adrenal crisis. To survive, patients with AI must replace the missing cortisol daily. Eton estimates that pediatric AI effects between 5,000 and 11,000 children in the United States.

About ALKINDI SPRINKLE
ALKINDI SPRINKLE is an immediate-release oral hydrocortisone granule preparation that has been specifically designed to meet the dosing needs of pediatric patients with adrenocortical insufficiency. Prior to ALKINDI SPRINKLE’s approval, parent caregivers had to cut or split higher strength hydrocortisone tablets to achieve the lower doses required for small children, which could result in inaccurate dosing. ALKINDI SPRINKLE is manufactured using commercially proven technology in four strengths: 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg and 5mg, to give greater dosing flexibility to clinicians. Taste-masking excipients that are acceptable for pediatric use eliminate the bitter taste of hydrocortisone. ALKINDI SPRINKLE has a shelf life of three years at ambient temperature and does not require refrigeration.

Indications and Usage
ALKINDI SPRINKLE is a corticosteroid indicated as replacement therapy in pediatric patients with adrenocortical insufficiency.

Important Safety Information

Contraindications

ALKINDI SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or to any of the ingredients in ALKINDI SPRINKLE. Anaphylactic reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroids.

Warning and Precautions

Adrenal Crisis: Undertreatment or sudden discontinuation of therapy may lead to adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis and death. Adrenal crisis may also be induced by stress events such as infections or surgery. Increase the dose during periods of stress. Switch patients who are vomiting, severely ill or unable to take oral medications to parenteral corticosteroid formulations.
Infections: Excessive doses may increase the risks of new infections or exacerbation of latent infections with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections. Treat all infections seriously and initiate stress dosing of steroids early.
Growth Retardation: Long-term use in excessive doses may cause growth retardation. Use the minimum dosage of ALKINDI SPRINKLE to achieve desired clinical response and monitor the patient’s growth.
Cushing’s Syndrome Due to Use of Excessive Doses of Corticosteroids: Prolonged use with supraphysiologic doses may cause Cushing’s syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome every 6 months; pediatric patients under one year of age may require more frequent monitoring.
Decrease in Bone Mineral Density: Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption which may lead to inhibition of bone growth and development of osteoporosis. Use the minimum dosage of ALKINDI SPRINKLE to achieve desired clinical response.
Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Use may be associated with severe psychiatric adverse reactions such as euphoria, mania, psychosis with hallucinations and delirium or depression. Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting the treatment. Most reactions resolve after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although specific treatment may be necessary. Monitor patients for behavioral and mood disturbances during treatment. Instruct caregivers and/or patients to seek medical advice if psychiatric symptoms develop.
Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Cataracts, glaucoma and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported with prolonged use of high doses. Monitor patients for blurred vision or other visual disturbances and if they occur, refer them to an ophthalmologist.
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Increased risk in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders. Signs and symptoms may be masked.
Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions for corticosteroids include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation in blood pressure, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite and weight gain.

 Lilly is testing both single Ab therapy, as well as combinations of Abs as potential therapeutics for COVID-19, across two different patient populations in P-II BLAZE-1, P-III BLAZE-2, and ACTIV-2 study. These trials are not affected by the enrollment pause in the ACTIV-3 clinical trial","ACTIV-3 is an independent, NIH-sponsored study in hospitalized patients testing bamlanivimab (LYCoV555) in combination with remdesivir

+ Independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended pause

+ Pause impacts the ACTIV-3 study of a Lilly neutralizing antibody; all other studies continue

+ Lilly’s other ongoing studies focus on earlier stages of COVID-19 disease or prophylaxis

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lilly has brought the full force of our scientific capabilities to fight this new disease, collaborating with the U.S. government and industry partners to discover potential treatments. Together, we have sought to learn about the potential impact of neutralizing antibodies across the broadest set of patients even as we were still evolving in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus pathology. As always, we have remained deeply committed to patient safety.

What We Know Now
As of last evening, Lilly continued to be in communication with the trial sponsor regarding the recommendation from the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) of the ACTIV-3 clinical trial to pause enrollment of the study. ACTIV-3, which is evaluating Lilly’s investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) as a treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

At this time, only the DSMB has reviewed the data from the trial, and NIH leadership and Lilly remain blinded to the ongoing trial results. Lilly trusts the judgment of the independent DSMB and supports its decisions to exercise caution in ensuring the safety of the patients participating in this study.

Importantly, the DSMB also considered the impact of the ACTIV-3 study pause on ACTIV-2 and did not recommend any changes to that study’s design or enrollment.

What Differentiates ACTIV-3 from Other Bamlanivimab Studies
The ACTIV-3 clinical trial is the only ongoing study evaluating the efficacy of Lilly’s neutralizing antibody in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the most advanced stage of the disease. The dose of bamlanivimab being investigated in this trial is 7000 mg.

Individuals in the ACTIV-3 study have been infected with the virus for a longer period of time and may have more severe symptoms than patients studied in other bamlanivimab trials. Hospitalized patients receive different treatments for COVID-19 than earlier stage patients, including treatment with the antiviral medicine remdesivir.

For these reasons, hospitalized patients may have less benefit from neutralizing antibodies, which are a supplement to the patients’ own immune system, as they may have developed their own endogenous antibody response and be in a phase of disease characterized by inflammatory responses to virus. This is why the use of immunosuppressive treatments is both widespread and still being investigated in hospitalized patients.

Lilly’s Neutralizing Antibody Development Program
Lilly is testing both single antibody therapy, as well as combinations of antibodies as potential therapeutics for COVID-19, across two different patient populations.

Lilly’s development program includes:

BLAZE-1, an ongoing Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501). This trial is testing both bamlanivimab alone and in combination with a second antibody (etesevimab, LY-CoV016)
BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention (prophylaxis) of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (NCT04497987)
Bamlanivimab is also being tested in the NIH-led ACTIV-2 study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.
These trials are not affected by the enrollment pause in the NIH-sponsored trial of hospitalized patients.

The population where Lilly has efficacy data for neutralizing antibodies is in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in high-risk patients. In this population, we also have a large safety database inclusive of over 480 drug-treated patients across a broad dose range and have reported a potential benefit in clinical outcomes with a reduction in viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalizations. In the BLAZE-1 trial, rates and types of adverse events were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity and with no drug-related serious adverse events reported thus far. In other bamlanivimab studies, there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, both patients recovered).

Next Steps
The scientific development process is challenging and unpredictable. It takes collaboration and commitment from scientists, researchers, patients, and companies across the biopharmaceutical industry to discover and develop treatments for diseases such as COVID-19. Every trial, no matter what it reveals, advances medical science and understanding – ultimately bringing new solutions one step closer to reality.

While we await additional data to help us understand whether neutralizing antibodies could play a role in helping hospitalized patients, we remain confident in the potential benefits of neutralizing antibodies in patients earlier in the disease course of COVID-19. We are grateful to the patients, physicians, and staff who have participated in our ongoing clinical trials. We continue to believe that the data generated in those clinical studies could support both the therapeutic benefits and safety profile of our neutralizing antibody in ambulatory patients and in prophylaxis.

50469,Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma,FDA Approves Expanded Indication for Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL),"The approval is based on P-III KEYNOTE-204 study assessing Keytruda (200mg, IV, q3w vs BV (1.8 mg/kg, IV, q3w) in 304 patients in a ratio (1:1) with r/r cHL after at least one multi-agent CT regimen
 Results: reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 35%, median PFS (13.2mos. vs 3mos); ORR (66% vs 54%); DOR (20.7 mos. vs 13.8mos.). The approval is reviewed under the FDA’s Project Orbis
 Ketruda is a humanized mAb that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 & PD-L2 thus activating T lymphocytes that affect tumor cells & healthy cells. Additionally, the US FDA has approved an updated pediatric indication for refractory cHL or cHL that has relapsed after two or more lines of therapy","October 15, 2020 06:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time
KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-204 trial in which KEYTRUDA significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88; p<0.0027]) compared to brentuximab vedotin (BV). Additionally, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-19.4) for patients treated with KEYTRUDA and 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.8) for patients treated with BV. The FDA also approved an updated pediatric indication for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with refractory cHL, or cHL that has relapsed after two or more lines of therapy.

“An estimated 8,500 patients in the U.S., many of them 40 years of age or younger, will be diagnosed with cHL this year. Now patients with cHL who progress after frontline therapy have a new option in KEYTRUDA, which has demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared to brentuximab vedotin,” said Dr. Vicki Goodman, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “At Merck, we are committed to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. Today’s FDA approval builds upon our growing range of options for people with blood cancers.”

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.

“The patients with cHL who do not achieve remission following initial treatment or who relapse after transplantation face a poor prognosis, reflecting the unmet need for improved therapies in the relapsed/refractory setting,” said Dr. John Kuruvilla, hematologist and associate professor of medicine, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and University of Toronto. “With this approval, KEYTRUDA has the potential to change the current standard of care and help these patients achieve better outcomes.”

KEYTRUDA was previously approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval process for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory cHL, or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy based on data from the KEYNOTE-087 trial. In accordance with accelerated approval regulations, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit; these accelerated approval requirements have been fulfilled with the data from KEYNOTE-204.

This approval was reviewed under the FDA’s Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. For this application, a modified Project Orbis was undertaken, and the FDA is collaborating with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada on their ongoing review of the application.

Data Supporting the Approval
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 304 patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. The trial enrolled adults with relapsed or refractory disease after at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks or BV 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks.

Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, documented disease progression or a maximum of 35 cycles (up to approximately two years). Disease assessment was performed every 12 weeks. Randomization was stratified by prior autologous HSCT (yes vs. no) and disease status after frontline therapy (primary refractory vs. relapse less than 12 months after completion vs. relapse 12 months or more after completion). The main efficacy measure was PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria.

Patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=151) or BV (n=153). The study population characteristics were median age of 35 years (range, 18 to 84); 57% male; 77% white, 9% Asian and 3.9% Black. The median number of prior therapies was two (range, 1 to 10) in the KEYTRUDA arm and three (range, 1 to 11) in the BV arm, with 18% in both arms having one prior line. Forty-two percent of patients were refractory to the last prior therapy, 29% had primary refractory disease, 37% had prior autologous HSCT, 5% had received prior BV, and 39% had prior radiation therapy.

In KEYNOTE-204, KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88; p=0.0027]) and showed a median PFS of 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-19.4). Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.8) for patients treated with BV. For PFS, in the KEYTRUDA arm, there were 81 patients (54%) with an event versus 88 patients (58%) in the BV arm. For patients treated with KEYTRUDA, the objective response rate (ORR) was 66% (95% CI, 57-73), with a complete response rate of 25% and a partial response rate of 41%. For patients treated with BV, the ORR was 54% (95% CI, 46-62), with a complete response rate of 24% and a partial response rate of 30%. The difference in ORRs is not statistically significant. Among the responding patients, median duration of response (DOR) was 20.7 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.2+) with KEYTRUDA and 13.8 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.9+) with BV.

In KEYNOTE-204, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 10 months (range, 1 day to 2.2 years), with 68% receiving at least six months of treatment and 48% receiving at least one year of treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received KEYTRUDA. Serious adverse reactions in those greater than or equal to 1% of patients included pneumonitis, pneumonia, pyrexia, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, febrile neutropenia and sepsis. Three patients (2%) died from causes other than disease progression: two from complications after allogeneic HSCT and one from an unknown cause.

Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to pneumonitis. Dosage interruption of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in greater than or equal to 3% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, transaminase increase and pneumonia. Thirty-eight percent of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were upper respiratory tract infection (41%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (22%), and pyrexia, fatigue, rash and cough (20% each).

About Hodgkin Lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. Worldwide, there were approximately 80,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, and more than 26,000 people died from the disease in 2018. In 2020, it is estimated nearly 8,500 people will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for more than nine in 10 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in developed countries.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-marketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risk of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

About risdiplam
Risdiplam is an investigational, oral medicine designed to increase and sustain survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels in the central nervous system and throughout the body. It is designed to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein to better support motor neurons and muscle function. Risdiplam was approved in the U.S. in August 2020. Orphan Drug status has been granted in the EU, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation for risdiplam in December 2018 for the treatment of SMA. In Japan, risdiplam has been designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of SMA in March 2019.

About spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disease that causes muscular atrophy and muscle weakness due to degeneration of the spinal motor nerve cells.1) It is the most frequently observed life-threatening genetic disease in infants.2) The incidence of SMA from infancy to childhood is one to two in 100,000 individuals.3) The causative gene for SMA is the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. The disease develops because of insufficient production of functional SMN protein from SMN2 genes alone, in addition to the dysfunction of the SMN1 gene.4)

50484,Sanofi and Translate Bio to Advance MRT5500 into Clinical Study Against COVID-19,Sanofi and Translate Bio mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate induced high antibody levels in preclinical studies,"The companies reported the preclinical results of MRT5500 demonstrating the potential of the vaccine in neutralizing the Abs against SARS-CoV-2. The two doses of MRT5500 induced neutralizing antibody levels significantly higher than those observed in COVID-19 patients
 The preclinical data support the advancement of MRT5500 for clinical development. The companies anticipate the initiation of P-I/II study in Q4’20
 MRT5500 is being developed under the collaboration between Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio and has demonstrated its ability to elicit an immune response in both mice and non-human primates in a preclinical study","PARIS and LEXINGTON, MASS. – October 15, 2020 – Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, and Translate Bio (NASDAQ: TBIO), a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, today announced the preclinical results for MRT5500, a mRNA-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease.

Preclinical evaluation of MRT5500, importantly, demonstrated a favorable immune response profile against SARS-CoV-2. These data support the selection of MRT5500 for clinical development. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. Full results are available here. MRT5500 is being developed under a collaboration agreement between Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio.

“To tackle this global pandemic, we must look to both the strong knowledge we have from years of infectious disease expertise and the promise of new, innovative technologies,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Today’s presentation of these positive results is another development milestone for providing a safe and effective potential vaccine against SARS-CoV2 and shows how promising this technology is. We are looking forward to working on next steps with our partner Translate Bio to bring this technology to people worldwide.”

“The rapid development of effective vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an urgent global public health need and I am encouraged by the progress we’ve made to date with our partner Sanofi Pasteur toward the development of a promising mRNA vaccine candidate,” said Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive Officer at Translate Bio. “The preclinical results we report in this paper demonstrate the ability of MRT5500 to elicit a favorable immune response in both mice and non-human primates. Importantly, these results provide additional support for using our mRNA platform to potentially expedite the development of alternative approaches to traditional vaccines.”

Key preclinical findings
The main findings of the preclinical studies demonstrate the potential of MRT5500 to elicit neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

In mice, four dose levels were assessed at 0.2, 1, 5 and 10 µg per dose using a two-dose vaccination schedule, administered three weeks apart. MRT5500 induced dose-dependent levels of binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 100% seroconversion was observed at all dose levels after one administration, and a further increase in titers was observed following a second administration. Neutralizing antibody titers were observed across all dose levels after receiving the two-dose-administration regimen. In the higher dose groups (5 µg, 10 µg), titers were detected after one administration of MRT5500 and were more pronounced after the second administration.

In non-human primates (NHPs), three dose levels were assessed at 15, 45 and 135 µg per dose using a two-administration vaccination schedule, three weeks apart. The potency of MRT5500 was assessed by two types of neutralization assays: pseudovirus neutralization and micro-neutralization. After the first administration, the majority of NHPs developed neutralizing antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and those antibody titers were further enhanced after a second administration with 100% of NHPs reaching levels significantly higher than those from human convalescent sera by day 35.

It was also demonstrated that MRT5500-immunized mice and non-human primates exhibited a Th1-biased T cell response against SARS-CoV-2.

The preprint publication “Immunogenicity of novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates,” is available here.

Shots on goal in the fight against COVID-19
In addition to the mRNA vaccine candidate in collaboration with Translate Bio, Sanofi is collaborating with GSK on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate using the same recombinant protein-based manufacturing technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines, combined with GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant platform. The Companies announced the start of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate in September and anticipate first results in early December 2020, to support the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study before the end of the year.

About mRNA vaccines 
Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents to stimulate the immune system, building up a defense mechanism that remains active in the body to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering a nucleotide sequence encoding the antigen or antigens selected for their high potential to induce a protective immune response. mRNA vaccines also represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches for several reasons – their high potency, ability to initiate protein production without the need for nuclear entry, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration using non-viral delivery. This approach potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not a viable option today. Additionally, a desired antigen or multiple antigens can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process, offering maximum flexibility and efficiency in development.

About the Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio collaboration
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. The agreement was first expanded in March 2020 to include development of a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. In June 2020, the two Companies built upon the existing collaboration to pursue novel mRNA vaccines to broadly address current and future infectious diseases.

This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the Companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a research term of at least four years after the original signing in 2018.

About Translate Bio
Translate Bio is a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction, or to prevent infectious diseases by generating protective immunity. Translate Bio is primarily focused on applying its technology to treat pulmonary diseases caused by insufficient protein production or where the reduction of proteins can modify disease. Translate Bio’s lead pulmonary candidate is being evaluated as an inhaled treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Additional pulmonary diseases are being evaluated in discovery-stage research programs that utilize a proprietary lung delivery platform. Translate Bio believes that mRNA can be delivered to target tissues via multiple routes of administration and, consequently, its technology may apply broadly to a wide range of diseases, including diseases that affect the liver. Translate Bio is also pursuing the development of mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases under a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur.

Galapagos is responsible for ROCCELLA in the US, where 326 patients were recruited while Servier will be solely responsible for trial in 11 countries where 606 patients were recruited
 The trial failed to meet its 1EPs as the change from baseline to 52 in cartilage thickness in mm (SD) is {-0.068 (0.20), -0.097 (0.27) & -0.085 (0.22)} vs -0.116 (0.27) for the low, medium & high dose respectively
 No difference in 2EPS including clinical outcomes, the therapy was generally well-tolerated by patients in the P-II study","Mechelen, Belgium and Paris, France, 15 OCTOBER 2020, 22.01 CET; regulated information –Servier and Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) report that no signal of activity was observed in the topline results in their ROCCELLA Phase 2 trial with GLPG1972/S201086.

ROCCELLA is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of three different once-daily oral doses of GLPG1972/S201086 in 932 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) over 52 weeks of treatment. The study population was aged between 40 to 76 years (mean age was 63), mainly female (70%), and with a mean disease duration of 7 years.

The primary objective of ROCCELLA was to demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of GLPG1972/S201086 compared to placebo after 52 weeks of treatment in reducing cartilage loss of the central medial tibiofemoral compartment of the target knee via quantitative MRI.

The trial failed to meet the primary objective. The change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness, in mm (SD) was -0.116 (0.27) for the placebo group and -0.068 (0.20), -0.097 (0.27) and -0.085 (0.22), for the low, medium and high dose, respectively. Statistically significant difference versus placebo was not reached in any of the treated groups.

There was no significant difference compared to placebo observed on secondary endpoints, including clinical outcomes.

Additional analyses are being conducted to fully evaluate the results, which will be presented at upcoming medical conferences.

GLPG1972/S201086 was generally well-tolerated by patients in this Phase 2 trial.

“While we are disappointed that ADAMTS-5 inhibition by GLPG1972/S201086 proved not to make a difference in this trial, we want to express our gratitude to all participating patients and investigators. This study result, while not what we hoped for, does add to the body of knowledge to help fight OA, a disease with substantial unmet medical need,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer of Galapagos.

“We are pleased to have performed this study with Galapagos. Unfortunately, the ROCCELLA results provided insufficient evidence of GLPG1972/S201086 efficacy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. We acknowledge the importance of assessing this innovative mechanism of action in the clinical setting and we will continue analyzing the data for better knowledge of the disease for the benefit of the patients and for future developments. We would like also to thank all patients and investigators for participating in this very important study,” said Dr. Patricia Belissa-Mathiot, Director of Clinical Development and R&D Chief Medical Officer at Servier.

50507,Novartis's Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec) Receives Health Canada Approval as the First Gene Replacement Therapy for Inherited Retinal Disease,"Health Canada approves first-ever gene replacement therapy, Luxturna®","Health Canada has approved Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec) as a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adult & pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells
 Luxturna is designed to provide functioning copies of the RPE65 gene to act in place of mutated RPE65 genes. The functioning genes work to restore vision and improve sight, giving patients the potential for greater independence
 Novartis has entered a partnership with Blueprint Genetics to facilitate the genetic testing where appropriate to validate the diagnosis","DORVAL, QC, Oct. 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. is pleased to announce that Health Canada has approved Luxturna® (voretigene neparvovec), a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells. The presence of biallelic RPE65 mutations should be confirmed by an accredited laboratory using validated assay methods1.

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of blinding conditions caused by mutations in more than 270 different genes, including the RPE65 gene3. RPE65-mediated IRDs often disproportionally affect children and young adults and cause progressive vision loss, leading to complete blindness in almost all patients 2. Luxturna is designed to provide functioning copies of the RPE65 gene to act in place of mutated RPE65 genes2. These functioning genes produce the RPE65 protein to help improve vision and prevent progression towards total blindness2.

“The effects of RPE65-mediated inherited retinal diseases can be life-changing. Previously, there was no treatment available and the progression towards complete blindness was inevitable.” said Dr. Elise Héon, an Ophthalmologist in the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences and the Director of the Eye Genetics Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. “This approval is a very important step forward in the treatment of genetic eye disorders.”

Due to the highly specialized nature of the therapy, Novartis is collaborating with key centres and their multidisciplinary teams to deliver Luxturna to patients across Canada: SickKids in partnership with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Ontario, and Montreal Children’s Hospital, McGill University Health Centre in partnership with Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (HMR), Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) de l’Est-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, affiliated with Université de Montréal in Quebec.

“Being part of tremendous innovations in the treatment of certain eye conditions over the past decades has been incredibly rewarding. Gene therapy heralds the start of a new era for IRDs and I’m thrilled to be part of this historic moment and equally excited to be able to give patients a chance to regain sight with Luxturna,” said Dr. Peter Kertes, retina surgeon and Ophthalmologist-in-Chief, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and staff ophthalmologist at SickKids in Toronto.

The current standard of care for people born with IRDs caused by RPE65 gene mutations is supportive in nature and focuses on monitoring, psychological support, mobility training and visual rehabilitation4. Until now, no pharmacological treatment option was available to treat the underlying disease mechanism or alter the natural history of inherited retinal dystrophies. While a genetic test is needed to confirm that vision loss is caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene2, it can be a lengthy process to access testing and counselling. Novartis has entered into a partnership with Blueprint Genetics to help facilitate genetic testing where appropriate in order to validate the diagnosis.

“The approval of the first gene replacement therapy for Canadians is historical. We have been waiting for this moment in the vision community for decades. To be able to tell a parent that their child’s impaired sight could now be restored or improved is remarkable,’ said Doug Earle, President & CEO of Fighting Blindness Canada. “We welcome this medical innovation and hope that Canadians in need of this therapy have access to it without delay.”

“Novartis is proudly reimagining medicine by bringing forward innovations like Luxturna. Today’s approval will have a significant impact on patient care,” said Andrea Marazzi, Country Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada. “We are grateful to the vision community for rallying behind Canadians who are impacted by vision impairment and vision loss and we are committed to helping them gain access to this game-changing gene therapy as quickly as possible.”

About RPE65 mutation-associated inherited retinal dystrophy
Mutations in both copies of the RPE65 gene affect approximately 1 in 200,000 people and can lead to blindness5,6. Early in the disease patients can suffer from night blindness (nyctalopia), loss of light sensitivity, loss of peripheral vision, loss of sharpness or clarity of vision, impaired dark adaptation and repetitive uncontrolled movements of the eye (nystagmus)6. Patients with mutations in both copies of the RPE65 gene may be diagnosed, for instance, with subtypes of either Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa7.

50565,Novartis' Leqvio (inclisiran) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Approval to Treat Hypercholesterolemia,"Novartis receives positive CHMP opinion for Leqvio®* (inclisiran), a potential first-in-class siRNA for the treatment of high cholesterol","The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on ORION program including P-III studies assessing Leqvio in 3,600+ patients on a maximally tolerated statin dose. Inclisiran demonstrated effective and sustained LDL-C reduction of up to 52% with 2doses/yr, after an initial dose and one @3mos., in adults with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalent or HeFH6
 80% of high-risk patients do not reach guideline-recommended LDC-L, targets despite the widespread use of statins. Reduction in LDL-C was achieved through 17mos. with a safety and tolerability profile like PBO
 Additional post hoc analysis demonstrated 88% of them reached guideline-recommended targets at any timepoint during the study. Additionally, the therapy is also under review by the US FDA and other health authorities for primary hyperlipidemia in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy","Basel, October 16, 2020 — Novartis announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting marketing authorization of Leqvio®* (inclisiran) for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, marking an important milestone towards it becoming available in the EU.

Inclisiran is a potential first-in-class small interfering RNA (siRNA) with a new mechanism of action which delivers effective and sustained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), ASCVD risk equivalent and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) a major driver of heart attacks, strokes and deaths1.

“This investigational medicine could significantly change how high LDL-C is treated6,7,” said Professor Ulf Landmesser, M.D., Director of Charité Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Berlin. “Many patients struggle to keep their LDL-C at recommended levels, and long-term exposure to high LDL-C is a major driver of ASCVD4,8,9. The unique mechanism of action of inclisiran provides effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, a causal factor of atherosclerotic disease progression. With only two doses a year, and as an injection administered by healthcare professionals, it is anticipated to remove adherence challenges commonly encountered with self-administered treatments1,6,7,10-13.”

“LDL-C reduction remains a major public health issue, with 80% of high-risk patients in Europe not achieving guideline-recommended LDL-C targets despite available current standard of care treatments. These patients remain at risk of ASCVD events, such as strokes or heart attacks3-5”, said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “This encouraging positive CHMP opinion is a significant step in our journey of reimagining medicine with this transformational treatment, which has the potential to bring new hope to the millions of people in Europe currently unable to reach their LDL-C goals3-5.”

This CHMP opinion is based on results from the ORION clinical research program including Phase III trials, which involved more than 3,600 patients on a maximally tolerated statin dose and assessed the safety, efficacy and tolerability of inclisiran6,7. Inclisiran demonstrated effective and sustained LDL-C reduction of up to 52% (P<0.0001) with two doses per year, after an initial dose and one at 3 months, in adults with ASCVD, ASCVD risk equivalent and/or HeFH6,7. Further, the reduction in LDL-C achieved with inclisiran was sustained through 17 months, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo6,7. Additional post hoc analysis showed low variability among the patients treated with inclisiran: 88% of them reached guideline recommended targets at any timepoint during the study (observed values)14.

The CHMP recommended granting inclisiran marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet:

in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximally tolerated dose of a statin, or
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated.
The European Commission (EC) – which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU) – will review the CHMP opinion and is expected to grant a centralized marketing authorization that will be valid in the 27 countries that are members of the EU. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area (EEA), will take corresponding decisions based on the EC’s recommendation. Following EC approval, Novartis will continue to explore innovative collaborations with health agencies and others throughout Europe designed to ensure that people with ASCVD and elevated LDL-C have access to the treatments they need to achieve beneficial health outcomes. Further, Novartis looks forward to the completion of the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes ORION-4 study, which will expand on the scientific evidence associating lower LDL-C levels with improved cardiovascular outcomes.

Inclisiran is also under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH) in adults who have elevated LDL-C while being on a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy.

About the ORION Phase III LDL-C-lowering Studies
ORION-9 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose6. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 482 participants with clinical or genetic evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-9, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 48% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 44% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 46 sites in eight countries6.

ORION-10 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose7. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,561 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated LDL-C, despite a maximally tolerated dose of LDL-C-lowering therapies (e.g. a statin and/or ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-10, inclisiran delivered mean placebo-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 52% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C reductions of 54% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The study was conducted at 145 sites in the United States7.

ORION-11 was a pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran sodium 300 mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare professional starting it at an initial dose7. Inclisiran was then administered again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter in 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C despite a maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe). For the primary endpoints of ORION-11, inclisiran delivered placebo-adjusted change in LDL-C reductions of 50% (P<.0001) at 17 months and demonstrated time-adjusted LDL-C reductions of 49% (P<.0001) from 3 through 18 months. The international study was conducted at 70 sites in seven countries7.

About Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)
Atherosclerosis corresponds to the accumulation of lipids over time mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the inner lining of the arteries. Unexpected rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque can cause an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke15,16. ASCVD accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths17. ASCVD is the primary cause of death in the European Union and its burden in the United States is greater than that from any other chronic diseases18,19. ASCVD risk equivalent corresponds to conditions that confer a similar risk for a ASCVD event (e.g. diabetes, HeFH)7,20.

About Inclisiran
If approved, inclisiran (KJX839) would be the first and only therapy to use the small interfering RNA (siRNA mechanism) of action to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which could help improve outcomes for patients with ASCVD, a deadly form of cardiovascular disease1,6,7. With two doses a year and effective and sustained LDL-C reduction, inclisiran works as a complement to statins. Inclisiran works differently from other therapies by preventing the production of the target protein in the liver, increasing hepatic uptake of LDL-C and clearing it from the bloodstream1. Inclisiran is dosed initially, again at 3 months, and then once every 6 months. In three clinical trials, patients taking inclisiran maintained LDL-C reduction throughout each 6-month dosing interval6,7. Administered in-office as a subcutaneous injection, inclisiran integrates seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine6,7.

No significant safety or tolerability concerns have been identified with the long-term administration of inclisiran. In the Phase III trials, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo6,7. The most common adverse reactions reported (>=3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnea, bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo and were generally mild and none were severe or persistent6,7.

Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics.

50574,AbbVie and Roche's Venclexta (venetoclax) Receive the US FDA's Approval for Acute Myeloid Leukemia,VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) Receives FDA Full Approval for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"The approval is based on P-lll VIALE-A & VIALE-C studies and updated data from the P-Ib M14-358 and the P-I/II M14-387 studies. The P-III studies involve assessing of Venclexta (400mg & 600mg, qd) + azacitidine & LDAC vs PBO + azacitidine & LDAC in 431 & 211 people with previously untreated AML who are ineligible for intensive CT respectively
 VIALE-A results: Reduction in the risk of death (34%), m-OS (14.7 vs 9.6mos.), CR rate (37% vs 18%); CR+CRh rate (65% vs 23%), median duration (7.6 mos.). VIALE-C results: CR rate (27% vs 7.4%); DOCR (11.1mos. vs 8.3mos.); m-OS (7.2mos. vs 4.1mos.). In 2018, the US FDA granted accelerated approval for AML
 This is the second time that Venclexta has been reviewed under the FDA’s new RTOR and Assessment Aid pilot program. Additionally, the FDA has granted five BTD for Venclexta, two of which are for people with previously untreated AML ineligible for intensive CT","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Oct. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided full approval to VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. The approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 VIALE-A (M15-656) and VIALE-C (M16-043) studies and updated data from the Phase 1b M14-358 and the Phase 1/2 M14-387 studies. The FDA previously granted accelerated approval to VENCLEXTA for this indication in 2018.5

“AML is a complex and challenging disease with generally low survival rates. This approval is significant because data from our VIALE-A trial has shown that newly-diagnosed patients, who cannot undergo intensive chemotherapy, lived longer when treated with VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine than those treated with azacitidine alone,” said Mohamed Zaki, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and global head of oncology development, AbbVie. “This trial also provides physicians more information for managing patients – from treatment initiation, to assessing response and management post disease remission.”

Positive overall survival (OS) data seen at an interim analysis of the VIALE-A trial led to an early submission supporting the FDA approval of VENCLEXTA in AML. The trial showed patients on the active regimen of VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine achieved a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to azacitidine in combination with placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.66 [95% CI: 0.52-0.85], p<0.001). The median OS for patients in the VENCLEXTA arm was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) versus 9.6 months in the placebo arm (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7). Additionally, patients in the VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine arm achieved a complete remission (CR) rate of 37% (95% CI: 31%, 43%) with a median duration of CR of 18.0 months (95% CI: 15.3, -) compared with patients in the placebo plus azacitidine arm with a CR rate of 18% (95% CI: 12%, 25%) with a median duration of CR of 13.4 months (95% CI: 8.7, 17.6). The observed safety profile was generally consistent with the known safety profile of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine. For patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, the most frequent serious adverse reactions (ARs; ≥5%) at first use were febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%) and hemorrhage (6%).1,6

Data from VIALE-A was presented for the first time as a late-breaking abstract at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress in June 2020 and recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.7

“For far too long, people with AML had very few treatment options, aside from very intense chemotherapy. Today’s news continues the progress of bringing more treatment options to patients with this devastating disease,” said Lee Greenberger, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

Data from the VIALE-C trial was presented at both the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the EHA Annual Congress and previously published in Blood.8 The median OS for VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC was 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 10.1) and 4.1 months for LDAC in combination with placebo (95% CI: 3.1, 8.8). The HR for the primary endpoint of OS was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52-1.07; p=0.114). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement of OS for patients with AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy at the time of the planned analysis. Efficacy was based on the rate of CR and duration of CR with supportive evidence of rate of CR + complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CR+CRh), duration of CR+CRh, and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. In the VENCLEXTA arm, the most frequent serious ARs were (≥10%) pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%) and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%).1,9

AML is an aggressive and difficult-to-treat blood cancer with a low survival rate.2,3 Despite recent advances in available therapies, the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with AML remains approximately 29%.10 AML typically worsens quickly, and due to age or comorbidities, not all patients are eligible to receive intensive chemotherapy.11

The FDA reviewed the clinical data under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program and Project Orbis initiative, which led to approval in the U.S. in October 2020. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners. The U.S. FDA, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, Swissmedic, Health Canada and ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) collaborated on this review based on the marketing applications submitted in their respective countries.

Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.

About the VIALE-A and VIALE-C Clinical Trials

VIALE-A (M15-656) Phase 3 Trial1,7

A total of 431 patients were randomized in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 VIALE-A trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (n=286) in patients with AML who are ineligible for standard induction therapy versus azacitidine in combination with placebo (n=145). The primary endpoint was OS.

The VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine combination showed a median OS of 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 18.7) versus 9.6 months (95% CI: 7.4, 12.7) with azacitidine in combination with placebo. The study also met its secondary endpoints, with the VENCLEXTA combination arm resulting in a CR rate of 37% (95% CI: 31, 43) and a CR+CRh rate of 65% (95% CI: 59, 70) compared to a CR rate of 18% (95% CI: 12, 25) and a CR+CRh rate of 23% (95% CI: 16, 30) in the placebo arm. The median time to first response of CR or CRh was 1.0 months (range: 0.6 to 14.3 months) with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine. The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range: <0.1 to 30.7 months) in the VENCLEXTA arm.

The most frequent ARs (≥30% with a difference between arms of ≥5%) for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine were mostly hematologic and gastrointestinal in nature and consisted of, nausea (44%), diarrhea (43%), febrile neutropenia (42%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), and vomiting (30%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 83% of patients in the VENCLEXTA arm, with the most frequent serious ARs (≥5%) being febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%) and hemorrhage (6%).

VIALE-C (M16-043) Phase 3 Trial1,9

A total of 211 patients were enrolled and treated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 VIALE-C trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC (n=143) versus placebo with LDAC (n=68). The primary endpoint was OS.

VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC did not significantly improve OS versus placebo in combination with LDAC. The HR for OS was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.07); p-value 0.114. The median OS for VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 10.1) and for PBO+LDAC arm was 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.1, 8.8).

Efficacy was based on the rate of CR and duration of CR with supportive evidence of rate of CR+CRh, duration of CR+CRh, and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence. The CR rate in the VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 27% (95% CI: 20%, 35%) with a median duration of CR of 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.1, -), and the CR rate in the placebo arm was 7.4% (95% CI: 2.4%, 16%) with a median duration of CR of 8.3 months (95% CI: 3.1, – ). The CR+CRh rate in the VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC arm was 47% (95% CI: 39%, 55%) and in the placebo arm was 15% (95% CI: 7.3%, 25%) with a median duration of CR+CRh of 11.1 months with VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC and 6.2 months with LDAC in combination with placebo. The median time to first response of CR or CRh was 1.0 month (range: 0.7 to 5.8 months) with VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC.

The most frequent AR (≥30% with a difference between arms of ≥5%) for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with LDAC was nausea (42%). Serious ARs were reported in 65% of patients in the VENCLEXTA arm, with the most frequent (≥10%) being pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%).

About VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) 

VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLEXTA targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.

VENCLEXTA is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers. VENCLEXTA is approved in more than 50 countries, including the U.S.

Uses and Important VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) U.S. Safety Information1

Uses

VENCLEXTA is a prescription medicine used:

to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who:
are 75 years of age or older, or
have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy.
It is not known if VENCLEXTA is safe and effective in children.

Important Safety Information

What is the most important information I should know about VENCLEXTA?

VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for TLS when you first start treatment and during treatment with VENCLEXTA. It is important to keep your appointments for blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with VENCLEXTA, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, or muscle or joint pain.

Drink plenty of water during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of getting TLS. Drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before your first dose, on the day of your first dose of VENCLEXTA, and each time your dose is increased.

Your healthcare provider may delay, decrease your dose, or stop treatment with VENCLEXTA if you have side effects.

Who should not take VENCLEXTA?

Certain medicines must not be taken when you first start taking VENCLEXTA and while your dose is being slowly increased because of the risk of increased TLS.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the- counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. VENCLEXTA and other medicines may affect each other causing serious side effects.
Do not start new medicines during treatment with VENCLEXTA without first talking with your healthcare provider.
Before taking VENCLEXTA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have kidney or liver problems.
have problems with your body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium.
have a history of high uric acid levels in your blood or gout.
are scheduled to receive a vaccine. You should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA, until your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. If you are not sure about the type of immunization or vaccine, ask your healthcare provider. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. VENCLEXTA may harm your unborn baby. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with VENCLEXTA, and you should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose of VENCLEXTA. If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider right away.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VENCLEXTA passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of VENCLEXTA.
What should I avoid while taking VENCLEXTA?

You should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while you are taking VENCLEXTA. These products may increase the amount of VENCLEXTA in your blood.

What are the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA?

VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:

Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). Low white blood cell counts are common with VENCLEXTA but can also be severe. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood counts during treatment with VENCLEXTA and may pause dosing.
Infections. Death and serious infections such as pneumonia and blood infection (sepsis) have happened during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor and treat you right away if you have a fever or any signs of infection during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a fever or any signs of an infection during treatment with VENCLEXTA.

The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA when used in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab or alone in people with CLL or SLL include low white blood cell counts; low platelet counts; low red blood cell counts; diarrhea; nausea; upper respiratory tract infection; cough; muscle and joint pain; tiredness; and swelling of your arms, legs, hands, and feet.

The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine in people with AML include nausea, diarrhea, low platelet count, constipation, low white blood cell count, fever with low white blood cell count, tiredness, vomiting, swelling of arms, legs, hands, or feet, fever, infection in lungs, shortness of breath, bleeding, low red blood cell count, rash, stomach (abdominal) pain, infection in your blood, muscle and joint pain, dizziness, cough, sore throat, and low blood pressure.

VENCLEXTA may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have concerns about fertility.

These are not all the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

Essex will be responsible for 80% of all costs and expenses in relation to the development of HLX04. After signing the agreement and upon reaching of certain milestones, Henlius is entitled to receive a signing payment and subsequent regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to US$43 million. In addition, Henlius is also entitled to receive US$30 million for every US$1 billion above the first US$600 million of the cumulative net sales. Henlius will also be eligible to receive royalties of up to 10% of the product annual net sales. Essex has a right to grant a sublicense to third parties and Henlius is entitled to receive 20% of the related sublicensing revenue, and the relevant share ratio can be adjusted through bilateral negotiation. Through this collaboration, Henlius and Essex will share the risks and costs in the development of HLX04 for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. This collaboration will fully utilize the advantages of Henlius in research and development and Essex in global commercialisation of ophthalmic drugs, to best strategize for the global development and commercialization of HLX04.
The incidence of ophthalmic diseases is increasing year by year in China, especially in the middle-aged and elderly patients. As of now, the number of patients with wAMD has exceeded 5 million in China and up to 30 million worldwide [1-2]. HLX04 (recombinant anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody injection) is a bevacizumab biosimilar independently developed and manufactured by Henlius. Via specific binding with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HLX04 can block the interaction between VEGF and its receptors, thus inhibiting angiogenesis. Results from pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated significant efficacy of VEGF inhibitors on ophthalmic diseases caused by fundus angiogenesis [3-4]. Since bevacizumab has not been approved for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases globally despite of its broad use, HLX04 has the potential to be one of the first bevacizumabs approved for these indications.
With the aim to benefit a broader patient population, Henlius is developing HLX04 for ophthalmic diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). In January 2019, the investigational new drug application (IND) of HLX04 for indications of wAMD and DR has been approved by the NMPA. With this collaboration, Henlius and Essex plan to conduct global multi-centre clinical trials of HLX04 in China, Australia, the European Union and the United States, and apply marketing authorization in different countries and regions around the globe based on the research results. Meanwhile, Henlius has submitted a patent for a new formulation of HLX04 with potential better safety and stability, designed for ophthalmic use.
In the future, Henlius will also actively collaborate with more partners to make progress by win-win cooperation and bring more high-quality and affordable biologics through consistently innovation to benefit patients around the world.

About oncology indications of HLX04


In addition to potential in the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, HLX04 is also essential for the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, growth and metastases [5]. Recently, the phase 3 clinical trial of HLX04 in metastatic colorectal cancer has successfully met its primary and secondary endpoints and Henlius has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) of HLX04 for the treatment of advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and has received the NDA acceptance notification from NMPA. At the same time, Henlius is also actively carrying out the clinical study of HLX04 in combination with HLX10 (an innovative anti-PD-1 mAb) of Henlius, and the indications cover multiple advanced solid tumours such as metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (phase 3 clinical trial) and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (phase 2 clinical trial).

50591,AstraZeneca's Trixeo Aerosphere Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval to Treat COPD,Trixeo Aerosphere recommended for approval in the EU by CHMP for the maintenance treatment of COPD,"The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-III ETHOS & KRONOS studies, which are a part of AstraZeneca’s P-III ATHENA program assessing Trixeo Aerosphere in 15500+ patients globally across 11 trials
 P-III ETHOS study results reported that triple-combination therapy showed a reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with the Bevespi Aerosphere over 52wks. In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Trixeo Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators
 Trixeo Aerosphere is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple combination of formoterol fumarate, glycopyrronium bromide with budesonide, delivered in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, and is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China & the US for COPD","AstraZeneca’s Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), or a combination of a LABA and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist.

Trixeo Aerosphere, a triple-combination therapy, is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China and the US for patients with COPD.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on results from the ETHOS Phase III trial in which Trixeo Aerosphere showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate) over 52 weeks.1

The recommendation for approval was also supported by data from the KRONOS Phase III trial.2 In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Trixeo Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators.1,2

Klaus Rabe, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Kiel, Director of the Department of Pneumology at Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, Lead Investigator of the ETHOS trial and National Co-ordinating Investigator of the KRONOS Phase III trial, said: “Preventing exacerbations is central to the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as exacerbations may cause irreversible damage and disease progression. The triple-combination therapy, Trixeo Aerosphere, has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing moderate or severe exacerbations in patients suffering from this debilitating disease.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is now the third leading cause of death globally and affects approximately one in 10 adults over the age of 40 in Europe. Trixeo Aerosphere has demonstrated strong clinical benefit when compared with dual-combination therapies and this positive recommendation brings us closer to providing a much-needed new treatment to patients in Europe.”

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.3,4,5 It affects an estimated 384 million people6 and is the third leading cause of death globally.7 In Europe, approximately 10% of adults over the age of 40 have COPD.8 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.3 A single COPD exacerbation can have a negative impact on lung function,9,10 quality of life11 and increase the risk of hospitalisation.12 Additionally, even one COPD exacerbation that results in hospitalisation increases the risk of death.13,14

ATHENA clinical trial programme

The ETHOS and KRONOS Phase III trials are part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Trixeo Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.1 Results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.1

KRONOS is a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Trixeo Aerosphere in patients with moderate to very severe COPD regardless of whether or not they had an exacerbation in the previous year. The primary endpoints were lung function parameters.2 Results were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.2

Trixeo Aerosphere

Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide) is a single-inhaler, fixed dose triple-combination of formoterol fumarate, a LABA, glycopyrronium bromide, a LAMA, with budesonide, an ICS, and delivered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.

Trixeo Aerosphere is approved under the brand name Breztri Aerosphere in Japan, China and the US for patients with COPD.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

Building on a 50-year heritage, AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, across inhaled and biologic medicines. AstraZeneca aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by eliminating preventable asthma attacks across all severities and removing COPD as a leading cause of death through earlier biology-led treatment. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential in rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in immunology is to achieve disease control and ultimately clinical remission in targeted immune-driven diseases.

50599,Janssen's Tremfya (guselkumab) Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Approval to Treat Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA),Janssen Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for Expanded Use of TREMFYA®▼ (guselkumab) in the Treatment of Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) in the European Union (EU),"The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on P-III DISCOVER-1 & -2 studies assessing guselkumab (100 mg, q4w/q8w) vs PBO in 381 & 739 patients with active PsA & patients who were biologic-naïve only & who had an inadequate response to standard therapies respectively
 Combined results: @24wks. improvement in ACR (20%); improvements in quality of life scores SF36; higher PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rate were observed. In both studies, Tremfya was generally well tolerated through study completion
 Guselkumab is the first approved mAb that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. If approved, guselkumab will be the first selective (IL)-23 p19 subunit inhibitor licensed for both PsA and moderate to severe PsO","BEERSE, BELGIUM, October 16, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending the expanded use of TREMFYA®▼(guselkumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the European Union (EU). Guselkumab is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.1

Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is an important driver in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as PsA, psoriasis and others.2

“This positive opinion brings us closer to the addition of guselkumab to the drug armoury for the management of psoriatic arthritis, which is of critical importance for patients. Psoriatic arthritis is an impactful, multifaceted and currently incurable disease,” said Professor Iain McInnes,i Muirhead Professor of Medicine and Director of the Institute of Infection Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow. “Long-term control of the diverse symptoms in joints, skin and soft tissue is required. If approved, guselkumab would be a welcome addition to our therapeutic options in the management of this disease.”

PsA is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease that is progressive and is characterised by debilitating joint damage and inflammation, in addition to enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3 There is no known cure, and it is estimated that up to a third of the 14 million people who are living with psoriasis in Europe will also go on to develop PsA.4,5

The CHMP positive opinion is based on data from DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, two first-in-class Phase 3 clinical studies, that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab 100 mg q4w and q8w for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients. Data from these studies were recently published in The Lancet in March 2020.6,7

DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants with active PsA who had an inadequate response to standard therapies, including participants (~30 percent) previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha biologics.6 DISCOVER-2 included 739 patients who were biologic-naïve only and had an inadequate response to standard therapies.7

Results published in The Lancet showed that in both studies, at week 24, the primary endpoints of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent improvement (ACR20) achieved statistical significance (DISCOVER-1: p<0.0001; DISCOVER-2: p<0.0001) in both q4w and q8w guselkumab groups (DISCOVER-1: n=255; DISCOVER-2: n=493) vs the placebo groups (DISCOVER-1: n=126; DISCOVER-2: n= 246). Significant improvements in quality of life scores (36-item short-form [SF36] physical component summary) were also observed in the guselkumab groups vs the placebo groups in DISCOVER-1 (p<0.0001 for both doses); in DISCOVER-2, significant improvements were observed in the q4w guselkumab group vs placebo group (p=0.0056 [q8w, p=0.068]). In addition, higher Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 percent improvement (PASI 75), PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates were observed in the guselkumab groups vs the placebo groups (in DISCOVER-1, all unadjusted p<0.0001 with PASI 100 being p=0.0005 and in DISCOVER-2, all unadjusted p<0.0001).6,7

In both studies, guselkumab was generally well tolerated through study completion, and observed adverse events (AEs) were generally consistent with previous studies of guselkumab and the current Summary of Product Characteristics.1 In DISCOVER-1 and -2, serious adverse events up to week 24 in q4w treatment arms (0 and 3 percent) and q8w treatment arms (3 and 1 percent) were similar to those in the placebo arms (4 and 3 percent). In DISCOVER-2, less than 1 percent of patients experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment, and no patient experienced serious infections following guselkumab treatment in DISCOVER-1. There were no reported deaths in guselkumab-treated patients and no guselkumab-treated patient developed inflammatory bowel disease, opportunistic infections such as tinea or candida, active tuberculosis or anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions.6,7

“We are excited to be one step closer to bringing guselkumab to both patients living with psoriatic arthritis, as well as to the doctors who treat them,” said David M. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Immunology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Guselkumab reinforces our broad commitment to developing first-in-class treatments for patients living with psoriatic arthritis and other immune-mediated diseases.”

Guselkumab was first approved by the European Commission on 23 November 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.1 Guselkumab is approved in the EU, US, Brazil, Canada, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).1 It is approved in the US, Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. A final decision from the European Commission (EC) regarding PsA indication expansion is expected later this year.

About DISCOVER-1 (NCT03162796)8

DISCOVER-1 was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in participants with active PsA, including those previously treated with biologic anti-TNF therapies. DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants and continued through approximately 1 year.6

The study consisted of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a blinded treatment phase of 52 weeks that included a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 52. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks after week 52 (week 52 to 60; 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent [at week 48] through to the final visit in the safety follow-up phase). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker evaluations were performed in the study on a defined schedule.

About DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285)9

DISCOVER-2 is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by SC injection in participants with active PsA. DISCOVER-2 is evaluating 739 participants and continuing through approximately 2 years.7

The study consists of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) that includes a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 100. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study agent. Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and pharmacogenomics evaluations are being performed in the study on a defined schedule.

About Psoriatic Arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by peripheral joint inflammation, enthesitis (pain where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the finger and toe joints), axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.3,10,11 In addition, in patients with PsA, comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression are often present.12 Studies showed that up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.4 The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30–50, but can develop at any time.13 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset and of the disease.13

About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)

Developed by Janssen, guselkumab is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.1 Guselkumab is approved in the EU, US, Canada, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light).1 It is approved in the US, Canada, Japan, Brazil and Ecuador for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis.2 In psoriasis guselkumab is administered as a 100 mg SC injection once every 8 weeks, after starter doses at weeks 0 and 4.1

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA®.

50605,Sanofi's Sarclisa (isatuximab) Receives NICE Recommendation for Patients with Multiple Myeloma,"NICE recommends Sarclisa® (isatuximab) for patients with multiple myeloma, an incurable progressive blood cancer1","The NICE has issued FAD which is based on the P-III ICARIA-MM trial assessing isatuximab + pom-dex vs pom-dex in patients prior treated with 3L treatment and at least 2L therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor with RRMM in 307 patients with RRMM
 The study demonstrated that the combination regimen demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death in adults by 40%, mPFS (11.5 vs 6.5), well-tolerated with no increase in treatment discontinuation
 Isatuximab is a mAb that binds to a specific site on CD38 and is now available to eligible patients through the NHS Cancer Drugs Fund. Isatuximab is the first mAb approved in EU to be used in combination with pom-dex for RRMM","READING, UK – 15th OCTOBER 2020 – The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) has issued a Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) recommending
Sarclisa® (isatuximab), in combination with existing treatment (pomalidomide and
dexamethasone, or pom-dex), for adults with relapsed/refractory* multiple myeloma
(RRMM) who have received three prior lines of treatment and at least two prior therapies
including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease
progression on the last treatment.
1
This recommendation has been welcomed by both the patient and medical communities
at a time when cancer patients, one of the most vulnerable groups, are facing a marked
impact due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with delays in treatment and services.
“We’re delighted that NICE has recommended isatuximab. Myeloma remains
incurable and is a hugely challenging cancer to live with. It is vital for patients to
know that treatments are there waiting for them when they relapse,” said Laura
Kerby, CEO, Myeloma UK. “The limited therapies available for patients at later
stages of the disease mean that increasing options at this point in the treatment
pathway is crucial. Having access to a treatment that can provide valuable extra
months without disease progression offers hope that people will have more time
with their loved ones.”
Date of preparation: October 2020
Document number: MAT-GB-2002766 (v1.0)
An estimated 5,700 people in the UK are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year, the
equivalent to 15 people each day.
4 There are approximately 3,000 multiple myeloma
related deaths each year, with almost half of patients dying within five years of diagnosis.
4
Multiple myeloma patients experience frequent relapses and the cancer can become
resistant to available treatments, making it much harder to control.5
“Despite a growing understanding of multiple myeloma, it still remains incurable
and carries a significant disease burden among the older adult patient
population,” said Professor Kwee Yong, Consultant in Haematology, University
College Hospital, London. “Trials have shown that isatuximab, in combination with
pomalidomide and dexamethasone, offers a significant advantage over
treatments which were – until now – considered the standard of care for adults
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Today’s recommendation,
therefore, provides us with an urgently needed new therapeutic option for this
group of hard-to-treat patients, for whom life expectancy and prognosis is poor.”
The ICARIA-MM trial demonstrated that isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone showed a reduction in risk of disease progression or death in adults by
40%, potentially extending the length of time a patient can live without their cancer
progressing (progression-free survival) to 11.5 months, compared to 6.5 months when
treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone (HR 0.596 95% CI 0.44-0.81
P=0.001).
2 Overall, isatuximab showed an additional 5.0 months without disease
progression.
2
Isatuximab was the first treatment in multiple myeloma to be awarded a Promising
Innovative Medicine designation and made available before approval via the Early Access
to Medicine Scheme (EAMS). The addition of isatuximab to pomalidomide and
dexamethasone was well tolerated with no increase in treatment discontinuation or
incidence of fatal events compared with that in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group.2 Sanofi is proud that through working with NICE, NHS England and the Cancer
Drugs Fund, eligible patients can now benefit from this treatment.
“At Sanofi Genzyme we are driven by all the loved ones taken by cancer, and all
those still facing it. We believe everyone affected by cancer deserve more – more
options, more support and more life,” said Nicole Farmer, General Manager, UK &
Ireland, Sanofi Genzyme. “We are therefore delighted at the recognition and
recommendation from NICE, meaning we are able to make a new treatment
option accessible to patients, offering a chance to delay disease progression.”
About ICARIA-MM
The NICE FAD is based on a cohort of patients from the pivotal ICARIA-MM trial who
received three prior lines of anti-myeloma treatment, including lenalidomide and a
proteasome inhibitor.2
ICARIA-MM is the first randomised Phase 3 trial to report results
evaluating an anti-CD38/pomalidomide/dexamethasone combination. It was an openlabel, multi-centre trial evaluating isatuximab in combination with pom-dex versus pomdex alone in patients with RRMM.2 The study enrolled 307 patients with RRMM across
102 hospitals spanning 24 countries, including sites in the UK.

About isatuximab
Isatuximab is a monoclonal antibody (also known as a mAb) that binds to a specific site
on a protein called CD38, a high amount of which is present on the surface of MM cells.
By binding to the CD38 protein, isatuximab helps the body’s immune system target and
destroy the cancerous cell.2
Isatuximab is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved in Europe to be used in
combination with pom-dex for the treatment of RRMM. It was granted Marketing
Authorisation in the European Union on 30 May 2020.6

 Rinvoq is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The submissions reinforce AbbVie’s commitment to bringing Rinvoq to more patients living with immune-mediated diseases","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Oct. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that it has submitted applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily) and adolescents (15 mg, once daily) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

The atopic dermatitis indication applications to the FDA and EMA are supported by data from three pivotal Phase 3 studies. RINVOQ was studied without topical corticosteroids (TCS) in Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 and with TCS in AD Up.1-3 In all three studies, RINVOQ demonstrated significant improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis compared to placebo.1-3 RINVOQ met the co-primary endpoints including at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI 75) from baseline and a validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16.1-3 Additionally, more patients treated with either dose of upadacitinib experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch, defined as improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)≥4.1-3 The safety profile of RINVOQ was consistent across the three pivotal Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis.1-3 No new safety risks of RINVOQ were observed in these studies compared to the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis receiving RINVOQ.1-3,8-11

“While there have been advancements in care, patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis continue to experience relentless itch and skin symptoms that can impact their everyday lives,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “These submissions are an important step forward in our commitment to providing an additional treatment option for those who struggle with this debilitating and often underappreciated disease.”

Atopic dermatitis is characterized by a cycle of itching and scratching that leads to cracked, scaly, oozing skin, which intensifies with worsening disease severity.4,5,12 Between 20 to 46 percent of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease.13 The range of symptoms pose significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.4-6

About RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1-3,14-22 In August 2019, RINVOQ received U.S. FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In December 2019, RINVOQ was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are ongoing.14-22 Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been established by regulatory authorities.

Important Safety Information about RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)23

RINVOQ U.S. Use and Important Safety Information
RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

What is the most important information I should know about RINVOQ?
RINVOQ is a medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking RINVOQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider (HCP) tells you it is okay.

Serious infections have happened in some people taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your HCP should test you for TB before starting RINVOQ and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ. You may be at higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).
Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in people taking RINVOQ.
Blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and arteries are possible in some people taking RINVOQ. This may be life-threatening and cause death.
Tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in certain laboratory tests can happen. Your HCP should do blood tests before you start taking RINVOQ and while you take it. Your HCP may stop your RINVOQ treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
What should I tell my HCP BEFORE starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP if you:

Are being treated for an infection, have an infection that won’t go away or keeps coming back, or have symptoms of an infection such as:
Fever, sweating, or chills
Shortness of breath
Warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
Muscle aches
Feeling tired
Blood in phlegm
Diarrhea or stomach pain
Cough
Weight loss
Burning when urinating or urinating more often than normal

(NASDAQ: BSTC), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, for $88.50 in cash per share, or an estimated enterprise value of approximately $540 million (net of approximately $120 million in cash acquired) at the anticipated time of deal closure.  Endo has had a strategic relationship with BioSpecifics since 2004. Under the terms of the relationship, BioSpecifics receives a royalty stream from Endo related to Endo’s collagenase-based therapies, which currently include XIAFLEX®, marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals, for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, and Qwo™, the first FDA-approved injectable treatment for cellulite, which is expected to be launched by Endo Aesthetics in Spring 2021.

“Acquiring BioSpecifics is consistent with our strategic priority to expand and enhance our portfolio through additional investment in the significant long-term growth potential of both XIAFLEX and QWO – two of our most durable and differentiated products,” said Blaise Coleman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Endo.  “This transaction will also immediately enhance Endo’s adjusted EBITDA and create significant value for shareholders of both organizations.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Endo, through a wholly owned subsidiary, will commence an all-cash tender offer to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of BioSpecifics for $88.50 per share.  The Edwin H. Wegman Marital Trust has entered into a Support Agreement committing it to tender its shares into the tender offer. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including that not less than a majority of shares of BioSpecifics common stock are tendered, the expiration of the waiting period under antitrust laws and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Endo’s acquisition subsidiary will be merged into BioSpecifics, and any remaining shares of BioSpecifics will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the same consideration payable pursuant to the tender offer.  The transaction is expected to close in late 2020 and Endo expects to fund the transaction with cash on hand.  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.

Endo’s financial advisor is PJT Partners LP and legal counsel is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.
