<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SAN DIEGO and TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, England, Nov. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX) and Sosei Group Corporation (""Sosei Heptares""; TSE: 4565) announce the signing of a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement to develop novel muscarinic receptor agonists, which Neurocrine Biosciences intends to study in the treatment for schizophrenia, dementia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Under the terms of the agreement, Neurocrine Biosciences gains development and commercialization rights to a broad portfolio of novel clinical and preclinical subtype-selective muscarinic M4, M1 and dual M1/M4 receptor agonists discovered by Sosei Heptares in development for the treatment of major neurological disorders. The most advanced program, HTL-0016878, is a selective M4 agonist. Neurocrine Biosciences plans to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and initiate a placebo-controlled Phase 2 study with HTL-0016878 as a potential treatment for schizophrenia in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sosei Heptares retains the rights to develop M1 agonists in Japan in all indications, with Neurocrine Biosciences receiving co-development and profit share options.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Muscarinic receptors are central to brain function and validated as drug targets in psychosis and cognitive disorders. Sosei Heptares has discovered selective muscarinic M4, M1 and M1/M4 dual agonists that offer the potential to deliver therapeutic effects while avoiding both the harmful side effects caused by non-selective agonists and efficacy issues experienced in some older patients caused by positive allosteric modulators that require cooperativity of diminishing levels of acetylcholine. Sosei Heptares achieved this through application of its world leading G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stabilized receptor platform (StaR&reg;) and subsequent translational medicine studies.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Our partnership collaboration with Sosei Heptares to advance their selective muscarinic agonist portfolio leverages the strengths of both our organizations with one goal in mind, to bring important medicines to patients who need better treatment options,"" said Kevin Gorman, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. ""We continue to add potential best-in-class compounds to our growing pipeline, which further positions Neurocrine Biosciences as a leading neuroscience-focused biopharmaceutical company.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shinichi Tamura, President and CEO of Sosei Heptares, added: ""We are delighted to partner with Neurocrine Biosciences to advance our selective muscarinic receptor agonist portfolio. The deal highlights the significant potential value within this portfolio and brings to bear the substantial expertise of the Neurocrine team, which is highly experienced in developing and commercializing novel products for patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases globally. It also enables Sosei Heptares to retain rights in Japan, where we are confident that we can make important progress leveraging our own expertise to advance novel candidates that aim to address this major unmet need. Overall, the deal is a great example of our strategy to combine our drug design and early development capabilities with those of later stage development and commercialization partners, while also providing significant funding to expand and advance our own pipeline.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About Muscarinic Receptors</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found in multiple tissues including the brain, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. Selective activation of M4 and M1 receptors in the brain is a clinically validated approach to treating cognitive and neuropsychological symptoms of neurological diseases, including schizophrenia, dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. Until now, attempts to develop medicines that selectively target M4 and M1 receptors have been unsuccessful because of side effects caused by the activation of M2 and M3 receptors. Highly selective M4 or M1 agonists that do not activate M2 or M3 therefore are highly sought after and expected to have the potential to address major unmet medical needs with blockbuster potential.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About Programs in the Collaboration Agreement</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HTL-0016878</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HTL-0016878 (""878"") is an oral, investigational M4 selective agonist that has completed multiple Phase 1 studies and Neurocrine Biosciences is preparing to initiate Phase 2 studies in schizophrenia in 2022. As a selective M4 orthosteric agonist, '878 offers the potential for an improved safety profile without the need of combination therapy to minimize side effects and avoids the need of cooperativity with acetylcholine (ACh) when compared to non-selective muscarinic agonists and positive allosteric modulators in development. Studies completed to date have shown '878 to be generally well tolerated.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Preclinical Programs</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collaboration includes rights to multiple preclinical programs which include selective muscarinic compounds targeting M1, M4 receptors and a dual M1/M4 receptor candidate. In combination with '878, the programs offer the ability to leverage M1 and M4 selectivity to address the unmet need for patients suffering from psychosis and cognitive-related diseases.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After signing a R&amp;D and commercialization partnership in 2016, Allergan returned all program rights to '878 and the preclinical programs to Sosei Heptares in Q1 2021.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 22, 2021-- Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced that it entered into an exclusive license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) under which GSK will develop and commercialize ARO-HSD, Arrowhead&rsquo;s investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic in a Phase 1/2 trial that is currently being developed as a treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&ldquo;Genetic studies have shown that HSD17B13 is a compelling therapeutic target for multiple forms of liver disease. Based on the clinical results generated to date, including those recently presented at the 2021 AASLD Liver Meeting, ARO-HSD could have the potential to be the first investigational therapeutic to achieve robust reductions in mRNA and protein levels of hepatic HSD17B13, leading to reductions in ALT, a liver enzyme typically elevated in liver diseases such as NASH,&rdquo; said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., Arrowhead&rsquo;s president and CEO. &ldquo;GSK has a global reach and impressive capabilities in the clinical development and commercialization of important medicines. As the work continues towards progressing further Phase 2 studies and planning Phase 3 studies for ARO-HSD, we believe this agreement with GSK furthers the potential of ARO-HSD as a promising new investigational therapeutic for patients with NASH and other liver diseases. We look forward to enabling GSK to advance ARO-HSD towards the millions of patients worldwide who do not have adequate treatment options.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&ldquo;NASH can be a life-threatening disorder in which excessive fat build-up in the liver causes inflammatory damage and fibrosis. The compelling genetic evidence linking HSD17B13 variants with protection of the liver from inflammatory injury suggests that there is an opportunity to produce a first-in-class medicine to reduce the clinical consequences of NASH. It&rsquo;s exciting to advance Arrowhead&rsquo;s promising RNAi approach into Phase 2 studies as an important potential new medicine for patients with NASH,&rdquo; said John Lepore, SVP and Head of Research, GSK.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Financial Terms</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Under the terms of the agreement, Arrowhead will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and is eligible for additional payments of $30 million at the start of Phase 2 and $100 million upon achieving a successful Phase 2 trial readout and the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, should the Phase 3 trial read out positively, and the potential new medicine receives regulatory approval in major markets, the deal provides for commercial milestone payments to Arrowhead of up to $190 million at first commercial sale, and up to $590 million in sales-related milestone payments. Arrowhead is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">GSK will receive an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ARO-HSD in all territories except Greater China, which will be retained by Arrowhead. GSK will be wholly responsible for further clinical development and commercialization, outside of Greater China.</span></p>
